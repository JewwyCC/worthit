Issue #6 Adidas D.O.N. Issue #6 review Dimitrije Curcic On on Mar 10, 2025 - updated  Jul 3, 2025 | Reviewed using methodology 1.8 Our verdict After our wear and lab tests, we can say the D.O.N. Issue #6 stands at the top of this series. Its supportive structure offered us wonderful containment, and its unbelievably sticky outsole maintained grip even on dusty courts! The best part is that this didn't come in a heavy design, as we moved quickly and safely through the court. The only issue here is that this Adidas hooper requires a break-in period. But don't worry, in our experience, it wasn't no way near as long and painful as other models' (yes LeBron 21 , we're looking at you!).

Issue #6 get away from you if: You only trust shoes with top-tier traction. You want to enjoy wonderful support and containment without the heavy build. You need something breathable but you don't want to give up on durability. Who should NOT buy Even though it's neither too long nor too harsh, this Adidas hooper requires a break-in period. In the first games of our wear tests, this shoe was slightly reluctant to bend alongside our feet, but it got better after a while. Personally, we didn't have this problem with the Issue #5 , which is also an incredibly solid performer. Your browser does not support the video tag. In our opinion, the Issue #6 felt quite comfortable, but just don't expect the softest ride out there. It's not like stepping on a rock either, but if you're yearning for that cloud-like experience, we also have some plusher pairs . Cushioning Shock absorption New You can rely on the D.O.N. Issue #6 for sufficient cushioning and impact protection as it returned standard shock absorption measurements of 102 SA in the heel and 77 SA in the forefoot. But don't expect a pillowy sensation from this Adidas shoe either as its Lightstrike foam is pretty firm. It will protect your joints upon landings but the priority is to keep you quick on your feet. Heel Forefoot Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 102 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New The low-rebound nature of the Lightstrike foam is another reason why the D.O.N. Issue #6 feels so grounded. Measuring its energy return in the heel, we got a notably low reading of 48.1%. It can feel dull and underwhelming if you are used to having a lot of bounce underfoot. But on the bright side, the shoe's Lightstrike Pro unit in the forefoot helps to add some spring to the toe-offs. It is reflected in a higher energy return of 58.1% under the toes but it is still slightly lower than average. Heel Forefoot Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 58.1% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack Even though this Adidas didn't offer much court feel, we really enjoyed the impact protection of its average stack height. At 28.9 mm, we can't say it's one of the tallest hoopers we have reviewed, but we were really happy with its cushioning during our wear tests! Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 28.9 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack Our caliper returned 20.9 mm when we measured this shoe's forefoot stack, so it follows the same logic as the heel. It's only slightly lower than average, but it was cushioned enough for us to be protected from harsh impacts. We were fine even after jumping for a rebound in traffic and getting hit mid-air. Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 20.9 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop There's not much difference between the rearfoot and the toe area, so the D.O.N. Issue #6 doesn't have a super steep drop. We did our math and saw it was average, at 8.0 mm. A high/low drop is neither good nor bad, and this choice is all about your personal preferences. Just in case you want to know more about it, here you have our super nerdy and helpful guide on the topic. Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 8.0 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. The nice impact protection we felt with this hooper comes from its cushioning. It features Lightstrike Pro foam at the forefoot and then regular Lightstrike everywhere else, which is what we measured. Your browser does not support the video tag. Our durometer returned 32.1 HA, and even though this result is notably firmer than average, we didn't really feel this hooper was like a brick underfoot. Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 32.1 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Adidas D.O.N. Issue #6 fits true to size (136 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit To know more about this shoe's fit, we created an accurate mold using our special gel. In order to create a 1:1 replica, we poured it into the shoe and froze it. Then our caliper could get the most precise measurements! Your browser does not support the video tag. At 94.3 mm, this shoe's width surpasses the average by quite a bit. During our wear tests, we really enjoyed this extra space, especially when we had been playing for a while and our feet started getting swollen. Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 94.3 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width At 67.4 mm, the D.O.N. Issue #6... tapers. So, yeah, we can't say we had plenty of space to wiggle our toes around. In fact, this shoe is pretty stiff, so don't expect it to give in like crazy after a couple of games! Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 67.4 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height The thing is that this hooper sits slightly low, but our standard-sized feet didn't really feel uncomfortable in it though. At only 21.7 mm, there wasn't room for us to push our toes up. Also, as we have already mentioned, the D.O.N. Issue #6 doesn't have stretchy materials, so what you get is what you see. Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 21.7 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New Despite its moderate price point, the D.O.N. Issue #6 exhibited top-tier traction in our lab tests! Sliding its forefoot against a specialized basketball court surface, our machine recorded some of the highest friction coefficients we've ever seen in hoop shoes - a whopping 0.99! It even undercut the high-end Nike LeBron 22 at 0.95! You can trust the razor-sharp treading of this Adidas shoe to stop on a dime in any direction and any scenario, no matter if the court is clean or dusty. It's an unbelievable value for money! Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 0.99 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New The Issue #6 features a circular pattern with two main pivot points. The thing is that those lines don't always follow the same direction, as they are divided into 6 different sections. Why? Well, because the brand's designers might have either played basketball for long or studied the sport pretty closely, as each pattern adapts to a different move you perform on the court with each part of the foot. Way to go, Adidas! Flexibility / Stiffness New Yes, the D.O.N. Issue #6 requires a break-in period and you shouldn't expect the flexibility of a yoga teacher here. Measuring how much force it takes to bend this Adidas hoop shoe, we got a standard reading of 21.3N. This is on par with the average of our lab-tested basketbal shoes. However, after only a couple of games, we noticed that this Donovan Mitchell shoe started moving more smoothly. New test (recommended) Old test Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 21.3N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight During our wear tests, the D.O.N. Issue #6 felt quite fast on foot. Its break-in period wasn't neither too long nor too harsh, so we got used to it pretty quickly. After a couple of games, it followed our fake shots and quick steps easily despite its rigid structure. We were pretty happy with this performance, but we were even happier when we took the hooper to our lab and saw our scale return 12.91 oz/366g. Surpasing both the Issue 4 and the Issue 5 in lightness, Adidas has definitely levelled up its game once again with such a structured yet fairly quick pair. Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 12.9 oz (366g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability Contrary to what our feet had to suffer with most hoopers, the Issue #6 didn't make us sweat like crazy during our wear tests. Even though that's what we experienced in the court, when we took this shoe to our lab, our light test was definitely not that positive about it. Your browser does not support the video tag. There was no way our LED could shine through such a solid structure, but we didn't give up. That's why we grabbed our smoke machine, and... look at all the smoke coming out of the shoe! It's not like we didn't expect it after our play tests, but the structure of this Adidas just looked like it wouldn't cooperate much. Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see in our video, compared to the Issue 5 and its sad 2/5 on breathability, this newest iteration showed great airflow. If it wasn't for this test, we would've never said that a hooper like this would be ideal to play ball in the summer. Our microscope agreed and it gave us one last hint. As you can see in the close-up picture, we're talking about a multilayered upper with small openings. So... of course the air would have it easy to come in and out! After our experience and all these tests, we have decided to give the Issue #6 a fantastic 4/5 on our breathability test. Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 4 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test We felt really stable during our playtests. The solid materials of this shoe kept our feet right where they were supposed to be, and we were never scared of our ankles overextending themselves. All in all, this Adidas seems to have joint safety as one of its top priorities... despite being a low top model! Your browser does not support the video tag. Torsional rigidity The solid support and containment we felt during our wear tests comes, partly, from this Adidas' solid upper. When we took it to our lab, we tried to twist it using our fingers, but it was futile. It just wouldn't move! Consequently, we gave it a 5/5 on our torsional rigidity test, but we could've given it a 6, or a 7... or a 10. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness The double heel counter is also pretty rigid. When we pushed it with our fingers, it didn't move much, but it cooperated a little bit more than the overall structure. All in all, we decided it deserved a 4/5 on our stiffness test. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 4 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot After hours and hours playing basketball with these hoopers, we can tell you we felt pretty stable. In fact, we were surprised when we took them to our lab and found out their midsole is not on the wider side! At 114.9 mm it's just average, but we didn't really feel like we needed a more generous base for our landings. Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 114.9 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The heel is way narrower than average, and even though our caliper returned 88.7 mm, our standard-width feet didn't feel like they needed much more space. Even though a wider base is always appreciated for harsh landings, like the ones you have to deal with when you score a 2+1 or 3+1, we can't say we were dissatisfied with this shoe's platform. Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 88.7 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability We're really happy we can say the great breathability of this Adidas pair did not mean its upper would be incredibly flimsy. Even though the microscope was already giving us some hints, we grabbed our Dremel and started drilling the Issue #6's upper with 2N of force and at 5K RPM. Your browser does not support the video tag. The green protective layer shielded the upper faithfully, yet the red material couldn't do much against the abrasive power of the tool. As, somehow, the shoe managed to survive the Dremel's attack, we decided to give it a 3/5 on our toebox durability test. Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 3 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability The heel told pretty much the same story. Even though the Dremel managed to mess it up, we were satisfied with its performance, so we decided to give it a 3/5 on our durability test. Nothing spectacular, yet strong enough to withstand constant use for a while. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 3 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness Our durometer marked 74.0 HC when we measured this shoe's outsole hardness, which is way lower than average. As this indicates the rubber used is on the softer side, it usually translates into a great grip yet lower durability. Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 74.0 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability Even with the durometer's low score, this hooper's outsole fought the Dremel with all its might. We can't say it won the battle cleanly but, once again, the results weren't so bad. Your browser does not support the video tag. When we measured the damage with our tread gauge, it returned 0.9 mm. Honestly, we're pretty happy with this result, especially if we take into account how soft the rubber used is! Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 0.9 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness Most likely in order to reduce weight, Adidas didn't go for an extra thick outsole. Our caliper returned 3.2 mm, which is slightly lower than average. So, even though you can play streetball in the Issue 6, it might not be the choice if you want it to be by your side for a while! Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 3.2 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness When we cut this hooper in half, we were welcomed by another standard insole. At 4.1 mm, it's slightly thinner than average, so it doesn't add any extra points to the cushioning. Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 4.5 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole This hooper features a very simple and standard insole (we absolutely loved the spider logo, though), so we can see why you'd want to change it!  Luckily, it's removable, but as the structure of the shoe is pretty snug, we believe you should be careful choosing a replacement. Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 Yes Reflective elements This hooper won't shine like crazy when the sun goes down, but the reflective touches on its eyelets are a nice little detail that we appreciated! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 Yes Tongue padding When we measured this shoe's tongue padding, our caliper marked 11.0 mm. This score is higher than average, which might lead to some thinking Adidas overdid it. Nevertheless, when we cut the shoe in half, we saw the padding was mainly on the top of the tongue, which is where we tie our laces. But we weren't really surprised by this, as the D.O.N. Issue #6's whole structure follows the same logic: there's extra padding right on the key areas! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 11.0 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type The fully gusseted tongue of this hooper offered great containment. If we add the plush piece at the heel (black in this colorway) and the padded tongue to the equation, the result is: no playing around for our feet! The rigid structure and the extra eyelet at the top helped a lot with lockdown too, so we felt safe and sound during our wear tests. Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 Both sides (full) Price We believe the D.O.N. Issue #6 has a fair price. It's not among the most expensive hoopers out there, yet its features and playability are wonderful in our opinion. Not only its X-plate, but also its support, solid structure, and out-of-the-norm breathability make it definitely worth a shot. Test results D.O.N. Issue #6 $120 Average $135 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes $70 Price $210 Heel tab In order to make our experience easier with such a rigid and snug hooper, Adidas decided to add a practical finger loop at the heel. It helped us a lot with this fully gusseted design, as we believe it would have been hard to put the shoe on otherwise. Test results D.O.N.

But as fun as that felt, we didn't think it was enough to justify the Cut 3's soaring price point. As a shoe that's meant for aggressive cuts, our primary concern was the lack of foot containment in the G.T. Cut 3. And we just couldn't let it slide. Top pick in best low top Nike basketball shoes Pros Exceptionally light and nimble Super plush ZoomX cushioning Amazing energy return and explosive toe-offs Great balance of impact protection and court feel Stable and rigid platform with an outrigger Fantastic grip on clean courts Excellent upper and outsole durability Comfortable in-shoe feel Cons Upper lacks the expected support for cuts Not for outdoor courts Lacks breathabilty Audience verdict 88 Great!

Cut 3, we believe that it is most suitable for players in search of the following: Premium ZoomX cushioning on a basketball court (crazy energy return!) Super light and nimble option for guards (who don't expect a lot of ankle support) Elite-level grip on clean indoor courts Who should NOT buy The shoe's lack of support was the main letdown for us, especially considering the price and the fact that the G.T. Cut 3 is made for cuts in the first place. We recommend looking into the Nike KD 16 or the Jordan Luka 2 if you need more substantial ankle support. Your browser does not support the video tag. In addition, both options are offered at a much more affordable price point. Cushioning Shock absorption New Intended for quick-footed and shifty players, the G.T. Cut 3 is not a very abundantly cushioned basketball shoe but it delivers solid impact protection for guards and forwards. With shock absorption readings of 102 SA in the heel and 76 SA in the forefoot, this Nike shoe proved to be on par with the category average. We can confirm that its cushioning will remain solid and consistent through all four quarters. But we do have reservations about heavier players using the Nike G.T. Cut 3. Given the plush nature of the ZoomX foam, we believe that it will lose its cushioning properties faster if the wearer is in the heavier weight class and/or if their playing style is jump-centered. If you recognize yourself in the latter, we promise that you will enjoy the cushioning setup of the G.T. Jump 2 or the G.T. Hustle 3 much more. Heel Forefoot Test results G.T. Cut 3 102 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New The G.T. Cut 3 is a ground-breaking release for Nike as it debuts a full-length ZoomX foam in a basketball shoe. First introduced in the brand's running shoes, this unique Pebax-based foam offers the best energy return in the industry! And just as we expected, the G.T. Cut 3 exhibited an exceptional rebound with high energy scores of 61.9% in the heel and 70.9% in the forefoot! It is one of the most explosive hoop shoes on the market, boosting take-offs, jump shots, and sprints with its propulsive ride. Heel Forefoot Test results G.T. Cut 3 70.9% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack Having sliced the G.T. Cut 3 in half, we were surprised to measure its heel stack at a lower-than-average 27.0 mm. Test results G.T. Cut 3 27.0 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack Checking the shoe's forefoot stack, we discovered that it falls right into the average of basketball shoes. At 21.5 mm, it provides a balanced experience between underfoot protection and court feel. Test results G.T. Cut 3 21.5 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop The difference between the shoe's heel and forefoot stack heights is rather low (5.5 mm). But this offset is very beneficial for shifty guards who want to feel closer to the ground. When the heel is not significantly elevated above the toes, it puts the foot in a flatter position which in turn, makes the wearer feel more stable and in control of the movement. Test results G.T. Cut 3 5.5 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. Just as we expected, the foam showed a very low reading on our Shore A durometer. At only 14.0 HA, it is 84% softer than the average hoop shoe midsole! It sits in the plushest corner along with the Boost foam on the Adidas Harden Vol. 7 (11.0 HA). To keep the squishiness under control, Nike encased the ZoomX inside a firmer foam carrier. So technically, you can't even touch the bare ZoomX from the outside of the shoe. The pinky panel you see on the side is plastic and not the foam itself. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results G.T. Cut 3 14.0 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Nike G.T. Cut 3 fits true to size (162 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit As our in-house replica of the shoe's interiors showed, you can expect a regular medium fit from the Nike G.T. Cut 3. Your browser does not support the video tag. With a slightly above-average width of 94.3 mm, the shoe offered us with a pretty accommodating true-to-size fit. New test (recommended) Old test Test results G.T. Cut 3 94.3 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width Its rounded toebox shape also eliminated the risk of toe numbing, even for longer hours on the court. Our caliper recorded a standard width of 70.6 mm in the big toe area of the mold. New test (recommended) Old test Test results G.T. Cut 3 70.6 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height The G.T. Cut 3 also provides an ample space above the toes with a standard toebox height of 23.5 mm. Test results G.T. Cut 3 23.5 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Lockdown On paper, the Nike G.T. Cut 3 checks all the boxes for a lockdown fit: the bootie-style upper, the supportive side overlays, the webbed Flywire cables holding the forefoot... But it felt as though something was missing to make the fit as secure as it could be. Perhaps more padding, sturdier overlays, or more substance in the heel counter? We're not sure but it seems like Nike aimed for a light and fast shoe above all else in the G.T. Cut 3. Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New Another major highlight of the G.T. Cut 3 is its extra-hard bite on the court. With a strong friction score of 0.73, this Nike shoe gave us plenty of confidence during quick cuts in particular (it's what the shoe was made for after all!). It would've been perfect if it weren't for the quick dust buildup on the outsole. So, do expect frequent wiping if you want to experience the shoe's peak performance. Test results G.T. Cut 3 0.73 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New The grip was especially efficient on clean indoor courts thanks to the shoe's thin and zig-zaggy tread lines. These are ideal for polished hardwood but can deteriorate too quickly on the blacktop. Flexibility / Stiffness New Now let's turn to the shoe's strong points. During our playtests, the G.T. Cut 3 treated us to pretty explosive toe-offs. This is in part thanks to the shank and the forefoot stiffness it provides. Our flexibility testing machine revealed that at 25.6N this Nike shoe requires nearly 25% more force to bend compared to the average hoop shoe. New test (recommended) Old test Test results G.T. Cut 3 25.6N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight We don't know what diet the G.T. Cut was following but its weight has dropped by a whopping 2.3 oz (65g)! The third iteration tips the scale at only 11.8 oz (335g)! Ah, wait, we do know the name of that diet - it's called the ZoomX foam (more on that in the Cushioning section). The lightness of this Nike shoe, as well as its amazing energy return, made it feel very fun and nimble on our feet. A fantastic option for quick guards. P.S. If you used to wear the G.T. Cut 2, expect the third iteration to be a complete reimagining of the shoe. Test results G.T. Cut 3 11.8 oz (335g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability The number of perforations throughout the shoe's upper tricked us into thinking that it is highly breathable. And yet, a quick playtest and a series of lab tests proved it to be otherwise. Your browser does not support the video tag. When we filled its interiors with smoke, the G.T. Cut 3 didn't let much vapor out through the toebox or the sidewalls. Your browser does not support the video tag. We also discovered that the perforations were not exactly see-through as the underlays blocked them from the inside. Looking at them through our microscope, we found that the inner lining technically corked the apertures. Disappointed in the shoe's lack of ventilation, we rated the G.T. Cut 3's breathability with the lowest score of 1. Test results G.T. Cut 3 1 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Nike's G.T. (Greater Than) series features shoes that above all else help you perform a particular basketball movement more effectively. Your browser does not support the video tag. The G.T. Jump 2 , for example, helps you jump higher and land better, the G.T. Hustle 2 helps with...well, running action on the court, and the G.T. Cut obviously helps with cuts (V-cuts, L-cuts, backdoor cuts, you name it). We ran a series of tests to check if the Nike G.T. Cut 3 has enough lateral stability to live up to the promise. Your browser does not support the video tag. In our on-foot demonstration above, you can see that the shoe's platform remains strong and stable whereas the upper has a bit of a give that feels suspicious. This is exactly how the shoe felt during the playtest - the sole kept us surefooted but the forgiving upper allowed for some ankle play. While it was not detrimental to the overall stability, we found it strange that a shoe designed specifically for cuts did not provide a higher level of stability. Just look at the Jordan Luka 2 below! That upper puts actual barricades on both sides of the ankle. Your browser does not support the video tag. On the upside, if you have strong ankles and prefer to feel less shoe around your feet and ankles, you might enjoy the Nike G.T. Cut 3. Torsional rigidity As we mentioned earlier, the platform of the G.T. Cut 3 is very stable and sturdy. We are glad that Nike came up with a way to combine plush cushioning with a steady sole. Your browser does not support the video tag. Failing to twist the shoe in our manual test convinced us to rate its torsional rigidity with the highest possible score - 5 out of 5! In addition to the firm carrier foam, the G.T. Cut 3 also features a stiff rubbery shank as a leading stability component. Even though it is only visible in the midfoot, the shank also runs through the shoe's forefoot helping to prevent the foot from twisting. Test results G.T. Cut 3 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness On the downside, we found that the heel counter of the G.T. Cut 3 was not as substantial as in most other basketball shoes. This is part of the reason why the shoe's upper support and heel hold felt weaker than we expected. It was decent but not as solid as in some of the other low-cut hoop shoes. Your browser does not support the video tag. Assessing the shoe's heel counter stiffness in our manual push-and-squeeze test, we gave it a lower-than-average score of 3. It's just not quite there... For comparison, the Jordan Luka 2 and the Nike KD 16 have a highly secure heel lockdown with higher scored for heel counter stiffness. Your browser does not support the video tag. Very stiff heel counter on the Jordan Luka 2 Test results G.T. Cut 3 3 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot Looking at the bottom of the Nike G.T. Cut 3, we immediately noticed that it had a slimmer profile than the average basketball shoe. Luckily, the forefoot part of the sole proved to be just as wide as the average at 114.5 mm. Our forceful lateral cuts felt supported by a sufficient outrigger on the lateral side. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results G.T. Cut 3 114.5 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The G.T. Cut 3 saved a lot of weight by shaving a chunk off its heel. Measuring the sole in the widest area of the rearfoot, our caliper showed only 82.6 mm. It is one of the narrowest heels we've seen on a basketball shoe. Also, please note that the shoe's heel has an unusually rounded shape (for a basketball shoe). It helps the G.T. Cut 3 feel more streamlined and nimble but heel-dominant landings might feel somewhat shaky. Test results G.T. Cut 3 82.6 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability The toebox of the G.T. Cut 3 is made of several materials: microfiber(ish?) material as the topmost layer sturdier synthetic overlays stitched on the sides translucent rubber toe bumper on both sides of the forefoot (very reminiscent of the toe drag guard on tennis shoes ) We had no concerns about the shoe's reinforced areas but were urged to check if the seemingly frail microfiber would sustain abrasion. Your browser does not support the video tag. Despite its appearance, the material showed pretty strong wear resistance! The sandpaper tip of our Dremel failed to get through it within 12 seconds, leaving nothing more than a cosmetic dent. Successfully avoiding a see-through hole, the Nike G.T. Cut 3 earned a high score for toebox durability - 4 out of 5! Test results G.T. Cut 3 4 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability Unfortunately, the shoe's interior lining was not as good at fighting our Dremel back. Your browser does not support the video tag. It only took a couple of seconds to blow through the heel lining of the G.T. Cut 3! Given how much friction occurs in this part of the shoe throughout the game, we don't think it would last a good while. Thus, we can't rate the shoe's heel lining durability any higher than 2 out of 5. Test results G.T. Cut 3 2 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness The outsole, on the other hand, amazed us with its exceptionally hard rubber compound. Our Shore C durometer returned a nice and high reading of 86.5 HC. It implies that the rubber is a little harder than the average which also signals higher durability. Test results G.T. Cut 3 86.5 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability Putting the shoe's outsole through its paces in our Dremel test only confirmed our best hopes - this rubber is highly resistant to abrasion! More so than the typical hoop shoe outsole. Your browser does not support the video tag. Even a 22-second exposure to sandpaper at a 10K RPM speed could not break through the rubber armor of the G.T. Cut 3. We found that the indentation was as shallow as 0.5 mm which is smaller than the average by half! Yes, that's impressive but when you stop and consider the shoe's brutally escalated price of $190... you take that durability as a given. Test results G.T. Cut 3 0.5 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness Based on our caliper measurement of 3.2 mm, the rubber layer on the G.T. Cut 3 is about a millimeter thinner than the average. However, it doesn't seem to affect the shoe's shelf life as much considering how hard-wearing that rubber is. But here is the question: is the Nike G.T. Cut 3 durable enough to tackle outdoor courts? We don't think so... Why? Even though the rubber itself is strong, the traction pattern on it is not. We are afraid that the lugs are too thin to resist hard outdoor courts and the treading will smooth out rather quickly. Test results G.T. Cut 3 3.2 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness A well-padded insole inside the G.T. Cut 3 makes its cushioning feel complete. With a thickness of 4.7 mm in the heel, it is just as cushy as the average basketball shoe insole. Test results G.T. Cut 3 4.7 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole This basketball shoe from Nike comes with a pretty comfortable contoured insole. But some folks (like those with very flat feet) may find the bump on the medial side to be annoying. If that's the case, they have the option to easily replace the stock insert. Test results G.T. Cut 3 Yes Tongue padding To keep the weight down, Nike chose targeted tongue padding for the G.T. Cut 3. About 2/3 of the tongue has no foam at all but there is a puffy little pillow at the top where the lace pressure is most apparent. Measuring it with a caliper, we found that it is actually thicker than average at 15.9 mm. Test results G.T. Cut 3 15.9 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type Just like most hoop shoes, the G.T. Vut 3 features a fully integrated tongue in a bootie-style upper. Test results G.T. Cut 3 Bootie Heel tab There is no pull tab at the back of the shoe. But there is a handy finger loop on the tongue to assist the on-and-off action. Test results G.T. Cut 3 None Lab test results Lab test Nike G.T.

You want to feel the safest on the court, so you need a hooper with wonderful traction, support, and foot containment. You're a bigger player, a center, or a power forward and you want a pair of shoes that understand your playstyle to bits. You can't stop watching LeBron edits on your phone and you missed its vibe and signature aesthetics. Who should NOT buy If you're looking for a nimble and minimalistic pair of shoes for your quick footwork, this ain't it. When we say the LeBron XXII is a tank of a shoe, we mean it. Just like the King himself! Apart from being heavy overall, this pair has a snug fit with solid materials that offer great containment and support, and that might make you feel it's even heftier. Anyway, if that isn't your thing, here you have the lightweight basketball shoes we have reviewed so far! Your browser does not support the video tag. The breathability of this newest LB iteration has gotten even worse. The XXI is an incredibly solid performer, and even though it keeps the legendary Kobe-like aesthetics, its score in breathability is better (3/5 compared to the 1/5 of the 22nd). Just in case that's not enough for you, we've reviewed many other hoopers that let our feet breathe just like a yoga instructor ! Cushioning Shock absorption New Even though it's an elite basketball shoe with cutting-edge cushioning technologies, the LeBron 22 does not feel as pillowy or cloud-like as some people might expect from a world-class hoop shoe. Its large Zoom Air unit in the heel couldn't bump the shoe's shock absorption measurement any higher than the standard 104 SA! Meanwhile, the Zoom Turbo and the Cushlon 2.0 foam in the forefoot performed even worse with a below-average SA of 74! This setup does not appeal to every player but it accommodates the build and playing style of bigger hoopers (like The King himself). This shoe promotes stability and surefootedness above all else. Heel Forefoot Test results LeBron 22 104 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New We found that the LeBron 22 feels snappy in the heel with an above-average rebound of 61.4% but there is no crazy energy return here. It offers a pretty dynamic underfoot experience but doesn't feel exceptionally propulsive. This in part due to the more moderate rebound of 57.5% in the forefoot. Heel Forefoot Test results LeBron 22 57.5% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack The Lebron XXII breaks with the Kobesque feel of the XX and the XXI to bring back the vibe of the King. Nevertheless, it keeps the lower stack of the line, as our caliper returned 27.1 mm when we measured it at the heel. Even if this doesn't reach the average, don't worry, as we believe this newest model features a top-tier cushioning that'll make you forget about its height. Test results LeBron 22 27.1 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack The forefoot follows the same logic. At 21.3 mm, it's also lower than average. However, we never felt this hooper lacked cushioning. In fact, we're pretty happy with its set-up, as it offers great bounce and wonderful shock absorption. Pretty much what big players like LeBron need! Test results LeBron 22 21.3 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop As both the rearfoot and toe area have pretty much the same stack height, we did our math and realized this Nike's drop is only 5.8 mm. This is neither good nor bad, as shoes' drops depend only on your personal preferences. Test results LeBron 22 5.8 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. Even though our durometer returned 30.5 HA when we pressed it against this shoe's midsole, the LeBron 22 feels plush. Its Cushlon 2.0 felt pretty nice underfoot, and with all the technologies this hooper features, the experience got even better. We got propelled back every time we landed, which was especially convenient to us when we pivoted under the rim. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results LeBron 22 30.5 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Nike LeBron 22 fits true to size (92 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit In order to measure this LeBron's width accurately, we used our new methodology: a special RunRepeat gel that we could freeze up afterwards to obtain a replica of the hooper's interiors. Your browser does not support the video tag. In this case, our caliper marked 91.4 mm when we measured the shoe's widest part. So, even though the synthetic leather upper of this shoe gives in a little bit, don't expect a lot of space. Test results LeBron 22 91.4 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width But things get even worse, as the XXII tapers... quite a bit. Forget about wiggling your toes and letting them play around. This shoe has a snug fit as it's for the support, and for the support only! Test results LeBron 22 67.2 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height At 22.1 mm, the vertical height of this Nike doesn't really stand out either. Once again, it's a score below the average, which is what we expected after experiencing its constrictive nature during our wear tests. Test results LeBron 22 22.1 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New We can confirm that the Nike LeBron 22 is indeed worthy of The King himself, as the shoe earned an exceptionally high traction score in our lab tests! Sliding its outsole against a professional court surface, our machine recorded a whopping coefficient of friction of 0.95! This hoop shoe clings to hardwood like no other, keeping the player confident and ready for quick, explosive, and aggressive moves. Test results LeBron 22 0.95 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New The LeBron 22 features translucent rubber with a multidirectional tread pattern. Even though it needed some time to warm up, once it was ready, we enjoyed a very solid grip in every single game we played. Flexibility / Stiffness New Both torsionally and longitudinally, the LeBron 22 is just really, really stubborn. This shoe acted like an armor for our feet, so of course it wouldn't be easy to mess with. It definitely needed its time to warm up and break-in during our wear tests which reflected in its measured stiffness as well. We weren't surprised to find out that this Nike shoe needed as much as 23.3N of force to bend to a 30-degree angle. Notably more than it takes an average hoop shoe. New test (recommended) Old test Test results LeBron 22 23.3N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight After reading this review this far, you've probably guessed the LeBron 22 is not a lightweight shoe. Just like our feet when we first put this hooper on, its snug structure feels heavy. We do believe it's designed for big guys, just like the King himself, who usually play center and power forward and need a lot of cushioning and containment. When we took it to the lab, our scale returned 15.56 oz/441g, which unsurprisingly surpasses the average. Seriously, when we say this is a tank of a shoe, we mean it! Its solid materials come with a price, which is this heavier structure. Test results LeBron 22 15.6 oz (441g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability After all the shoes we have tested... we don't trust perforation holes any more! We check them carefully, and the LeBron 22's flopped on our light test. Your browser does not support the video tag. The LED just can't shine through any of them, so the air shouldn't be able to get through them easily either! In fact, when we even had to check if our smoke machine was on during this second part of our breathability test, and nothing was coming out of this Nike pair. In comparison to the Ja 2 , its performance was so bad that we could only give it a sad 1/5 on breathability. Just like we thought, this Nike's ventilation holes seem to be merely decorative, as there's a solid layer underneath that blocks air, light, and anything else that tries to get it! Test results LeBron 22 1 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Overall, the stability of this shoe is just superb. During our wear tests, we felt safe and supported, as the LeBron XXII's containment is almost unmatched. You can see it in the video below, this tank of a shoe is ready to hold your feet in place! Your browser does not support the video tag. A top-loaded shank is one of the midsole components that adds stability and structure to the LeBron 22. Your browser does not support the video tag. Torsional rigidity Twisting the LB 22? Nice joke. It's absolutely impossible! This shoe features what the brand calls a saddle. This piece covers the midfoot and some of the forefoot, adding a lot of structure and support to the shoe. Consequently, it's nearly impossible to wring it, so we've given it a 5/5 on our torsional rigidity test (and if we could give it a 50, we would have, trust us). Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results LeBron 22 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness We tried to push the heel too, but it was impossible for our thumb. Nevertheless, the sides of the rearfoot actually gave in a little bit more, and that's literally the only reason with the LeBron 22 got a 3/5 on our heel counter stiffness test. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results LeBron 22 3 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot We believe this LeBron's landing base is wide enough for any moves performed by the center position in basketball. Be it pivoting, stepping closer to the rim, jumping for a rebound or anything on those lines, we never felt like our feet lacked room when they were back on the court again. Hence, the 115.6 mm of width this shoe's midsole has at the forefoot were just what we needed. Test results LeBron 22 115.6 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel On the other hand, the midsole is narrower than average at the heel. Our caliper returned 85.4 mm when we measured it, and even though the wider the landing platform, the more stability, we never felt like the LeBron 22 was lacking in this aspect. Test results LeBron 22 85.4 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability The breathability of the LeBron 22 was so bad that we expected great durability. Luckily, that's what we got, as this shoe faced our Dremel bravely. At 5K RPM and with 2N of force, the tool drilled the synthetic leather upper of this hooper, yet it couldn't do much. We were pretty happy with its performance, so we decided to give it a 4/5 on our toebox durability test. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results LeBron 22 4 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability The Nike sphere lining of the heel withstood the abrasion of our Dremel pretty well too! The damage was almost non-existent, so we decided to give the LeBron 22 another solid 4/5 on durability. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results LeBron 22 4 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness At 76.5 HC, our durometer reminded us that this shoe's outsole is hard, yet not as much as the average. If we had seen this result before trying the LeBron 22 on our own feet, it would've worked as a great hint for the amazing grip we enjoyed whilst playing basketball. Test results LeBron 22 76.5 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability Apart from wonderful traction, this hooper's outsole also demonstrated fantastic durability. Even though the Dremel went all in at 10K RPM and with the same 2N of force, the LeBron 22 fought back fiercely. Our tread gauge marked that the result dent was only 0.7 mm deep, which just confirms this pair is ready to last. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results LeBron 22 0.7 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness Taking into account these 2 wonderful results regarding the outsole, we believe Nike understood it didn't really need to go all out here. In other words, the brand didn't have to use more than 3.9 mm of rubber for this piece (as its durability is already great), which is just the average. And we totally agree: let's not add any unnecessary weight! Test results LeBron 22 3.9 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness The insole of the LeBron XXII looks pretty neat, but there's nothing special to say about it. Its standard and its thickness goes up to 4.6 mm, which is just average. Test results LeBron 22 4.6 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole This Nike pair has a removable insole that you can change if you want or need to. Just remember that it's a snug shoe and its leather won't stretch like crazy (especially not the first times you wear it!), so going for an overly thick orthotic might jeopardize comfort. Test results LeBron 22 Yes Reflective elements This colorway doesn't have any reflective elements, but there are some others among the LeBron 22 that do! (Just watch out for a potential price increase, though). Test results LeBron 22 No Tongue padding At 9.4 mm, this hooper's tongue does feel luxurious. Never ever did we have to deal with any kind of lace bite or uncomfortable rubbing, as this plush shield protected us from it all. The good news is that the weight of the LeBron XXII might as well come from its overall padded structure. Apart from the tongue and the heel, the upper in general also focuses on being comfortable. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results LeBron 22 9.4 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Price The fact that the LeBron XXII came out costing $180 was a pleasant surprise to us. There's a tendency where hoopers are getting more and more expensive nowadays, and we thought this performer would go all the way up to $200. It does have a lot of technologies and fastatic playability, so even though we can see it being a little bit too pricey for a lot of people, we also believe it's worth the investment. Test results LeBron 22 $190 Average $135 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes $70 Price $210 Heel tab Even though the LeBron 22 doesn't feature a gusseted tongue, its stiff structure didn't make it easy for us to put it on. The thing is that it doesn't have a heel tab either, so you gotta untie its laces properly before squeezing your feet into it. And talking about laces, this colorway comes with 2 different pairs, and in this picture we're using the ones made with this towel-textured material. They looked fun so we wanted to try them out, yet we believe it's an either love it or hate it detail. Personally, we'd stick to regular laces... these aren't our cup of tea!

The Dame 9 features a wonderfully supportive and stable structure that let us go for the riskier moves during our wear tests, and thanks to its impact protection and responsiveness, we were never afraid to jump and hit our defenders mid-air. The lockdown feel it provided is immaculate, yet its solid materials just unavoidably send it to the heavier hoopers category.

You're constantly jumping on the court, so you need extra impact protection and a wide landing base. You're looking for some snap but you don't want to miss out on comfort. Who should NOT buy Even though it's not much, the Dame 9 is heavier than most hoopers. Personally, it wasn't something that made us slow down during our games, and we didn't find it ridiculously bottom-heavy either. Still, we can see why you'd rather get a quicker pair, so here you have the lightweight basketball shoes we've reviewed so far. Your browser does not support the video tag. On another note, we're happy with this shoe's grip levels, yet we believe Adidas hasn't fixed the \"dust magnet\" nature of the Dame 8 . Our grip tests showed that the Adidas D.O.N. Issue #6 and the Anthony Edwards 1 offer top-tier traction at the same price point. Cushioning Shock absorption New Fully made of Lightstrike foam, the Dame 9's midsole provides excellent impact protection for most types of players. The shoe is better cushioned in the heel with a solid shock absorption measurement of 105 SA. It shows less compression in the forefoot but it is on par with the average at 81 SA and offers enough protection for the ball of the foot and the toe joints. Heel Forefoot Test results Dame 9 105 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New Our energy return measurements showed that the Lightstrike in the Dame 9 is not as bouncy as the brand's Boost foam in the Anthony Edwards 1 shoe. It's not a dull shoe by any means but its rebound feels limited at 53.8% in the heel and 54.9% in the forefoot. Thus, the Dame 9 is better suited for players who prefer a more stable and grounded experience to explosiveness. Heel Forefoot Test results Dame 9 54.9% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack At 27.8 mm, this Adidas' heel stack is slightly lower than average. Still, we really liked its cushioning, as it offered great impact protection every time we jumped to get a rebound or for a shot! Test results Dame 9 27.8 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack The forefoot stack is also a little bit lower than average. Our caliper returned 20.1 mm, but we never felt like this hooper lacked cushioning. In fact, we enjoyed loads of comfort during our wear tests! So, just to make it clear: comfort, impact protection, and shock absorption aren't exclusive of taller midsoles. Test results Dame 9 20.1 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop The heel and forefoot stacks of this hooper left us with a drop of 7.7 mm. It is an average result which means the Dame 9 feels just like any other basketball pair. Nothing unexpected or special here! Test results Dame 9 7.7 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. The softer foam of the Dame 9 scored 23.6 HA when we analyzed it using our durometer. Thanks to our wear tests, we can say this Lightstrike foam feels soft underfoot. The best part is that it got better with time, and we could enjoy its comfort and responsive ride in every single match we played. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Dame 9 23.6 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Adidas Dame 9 fits true to size (267 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit To measure the width of our shoes, we have developed this just as nerdy as effective technique where we create a gel mold of their interiors. Your browser does not support the video tag. When our favourite green material goes from liquid to solid, it imitates the shape of the shoe we put it in. Then we take it out and measure it with our caliper. In the case of the Dame 9, it returned 95.4 mm, which is way higher than average. And you know what that means, right? Some extra space! Test results Dame 9 95.4 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width The width of this Adidas hooper at the big toe also surpasses our lab average in this category. At 71.0 mm, we had some extra space to wiggle and readjust our toes after landing from a rebound. Test results Dame 9 71.0 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height The thing is that this Adidas hooper sits quite low: when we measured its toebox height, our caliper marked 22.7 mm. That being said, don't expect the upper materials to give in comfortably, as they are pretty stiff overall! Test results Dame 9 22.7 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New The Dame 9 offers good grip overall but it's not world-class traction for sure. Measuring how much friction the shoe's forefoot generates against polished court flooring, we recorded a moderate reading of 0.69. Test results Dame 9 0.69 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New The Dame 9 shows off a wavy thunderbolt-like pattern on a translucent rubber outsole from the back to the front. There are two big flex grooves: one vertical at the heel and another one horizontal right between the mid and the forefoot areas. Even though both of them increased flexibility, the break-in period of this hooper was still present. The transparent nature of rubber also allows us to see the shoe's infinity plate which adds some extra points to the overall stiffness of the shoe (as well as some snap). Flexibility / Stiffness New The solid and rigid structure of this shoe is stiff both torsionally and longitudinally. In our flex test, the Dame 9 scored 23.8N, which is notably higher than average. This means it's harder to bend, so this hooper required a little bit of a warm-up before it could follow our moves smoothly. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Dame 9 23.8N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight Even though this pair isn't excessively bottom heavy, it definitely doesn't belong to our lightweight hoopers category. We could kind of feel it even before taking it to our lab, but the one that confirmed it was our scale. Marking 14.71 oz/417g, in our experience the Dame 9 is a solid shoe that you can play quick with, but that won't feel and follow your moves as well as more nimble pairs. Test results Dame 9 14.7 oz (417g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability With this solid, thick and multilayered upper, we didn't really expect the Dame 9 to be the most breathable shoe out there. In fact, our feet felt kind of sweaty if we played for hours, which already wasn't a good sign. Your browser does not support the video tag. During our light test, the LED couldn't really shine through the upper, but somehow it managed to find some small ventilation holes through the tongue. That's exactly the point where the smoke from our smoke machine managed to get out of the shoe, too! Confirming it actually allows airflow. Your browser does not support the video tag. That being said, there's not much for us to say about the Dame 9's breathability, as it pales in comparison to the Nike G.T. Hustle 3 's. You can see it clearly in the video above, as the later lets all the smoke out easily, earning a 5/5 on our breathability test. On the other hand, we could only give the Dame 9 a sad 2/5 on ventilation. Look at how thick that material is... there's no way the air could get in and out of the shoe freely! Test results Dame 9 2 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Following our experience, the Dame 9 felt incredibly stable during our playtests. As you can see in the video below, our feet didn't stand a chance against this shoe. Our ankles couldn't play around or overextend themselves, as this Adidas offered wonderful containment. Your browser does not support the video tag. Torsional rigidity As expected after our well-deserved praise on the lateral stability test, this hooper got the highest score in our torsional rigidity test (5/5). There was no way we could bend the Dame 9 with our hands, as the synthetic upper and high lateral walls just wouldn't let us. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Dame 9 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness We didn't have any heel slippage issues with this shoe during our wear tests. When we took it to our lab, we checked it by pressing the back area with our fingers and thumbs. It put up a good fight, but it was friendly enough not to hurt us when we played basketball. Consequently, we decided to give a 4/5 on our stiffness test. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Dame 9 4 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot The wonderful stability we felt during our wear tests wasn't just thanks to the solid upper of this hooper, but also to its incredibly spacious midsole. When we measured its width in the forefoot, our caliper returned 120.1 mm, which means it's far roomier than average. Consequently, we had loads of space to land after jump shots, rebounds, and even risky blocks! Test results Dame 9 120.1 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The heel is also wider than average at 93.0 mm. Even though the gap in comparison to the standard is not as big as in the forefoot, we really appreciated this extra space. Test results Dame 9 93.0 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability The amount of layers and the solid materials of this Adidas hooper didn't play tricks on us. We expected great durability and, after our Dremel test, that's exactly what we got! At 5K RPM and with 2N of force, the tool drilled this shoe's toebox non-stop. Your browser does not support the video tag. The results were so good that we gave it a fantastic 4/5 on our durability test, demonstrating that its upper is ready to last! Test results Dame 9 4 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability Even though the heel area of most shoes tends to be weak, this Adidas hooper showed us it's not here to play games with the Dremel once again. At 5K RPM and with the same 2N of force, the tool couldn't do much but scratch the padding, so we decided to give it another 4/5 on durability. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Dame 9 4 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness Our durometer marked 81.5 HC when we measured this shoe's outsole hardness. This result is pretty much average, which indicates the rubber used should offer a healthy mix of durability and traction. Test results Dame 9 81.5 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability This time at 10K RPM and with the same 2N of force, our Dremel drilled this shoe's outsole mercilessly. Once the 18 seconds were up, we measured the damage to check its depth. Our tread gauge returned 0.8 mm, which is lower than average. This means the Dame 9's outsole should be by your side for a while! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Dame 9 0.8 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness After seeing such a positive result on our outsole durability test, we can understand why Adidas decided not to go for an overly thick piece of rubber. In fact, our caliper returned only 3.1 mm, which is fairly lower than average. Nevertheless, we were never scared of this hooper's outsole leaving our side sooner than expected. Test results Dame 9 3.1 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness A 4.1 mm insole was nothing unexpected. We've been seeing this slimmer orthotic in many hoopers from Adidas , so it's become the regular for us. Test results Dame 9 4.1 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole As the Dame 9 features a removable insole, you can always change it if you need or have to. Test results Dame 9 Yes Reflective elements The fact that these hoopers have a reflective 0 at the back just makes them even cooler. We checked it in our lab with the lights off, look at that! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Dame 9 Yes Tongue padding We believe Adidas tried its best to reduce this shoe's weight here and there. That's why our caliper returned 4.6 mm when we measured the Dame 9's tongue padding, which is way lower than average. After all, we're already talking about a heavier hooper, so adding more than the necessary padding to make it comfortable would be detrimental. That's the logic the whole shoe follows, as the only extra plush area is the heel. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Dame 9 4.6 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type The Dame 9 has a bootie-like structure that hugged our feet comfortably and... tightly. Its snug fit might not be everyone's cup of tea, but it does feel really supportive. Also, when we were checking this structure, we realized there was an extra eyelet at the top! Test results Dame 9 Bootie Price The wonderful support and stability this hooper offers was already worth its price for us. Many hoopers look for a pair with fairly good traction and a solid upper that makes sure their feet stay right where they should, and that's the Dame 9! Test results Dame 9 $120 Average $135 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes $70 Price $210 Heel tab In order to help us with its bootie structure and tight fit, Adidas added a practical finger loop at the back of this shoe that we could pull to put the Dame 9 on and off.

It keeps the same solid and trustworthy design, featuring a durable yet breathable structure that offers wonderful support and containment. During our wear tests, we also noticed its snappy nature and bounce, as it pushed us back up every time we landed after a rebound or a jump shot. Nevertheless, despite being the lightest of their siblings, this hooper is still on the heavier side of its category. The solid lock-in feel and traction make this pair ideal for quick guards, but its weight might be a drawback.

You're a fan of hoopers that offer great containment that doesn't jeopardize comfort. You love James Harden (and his beard). Who should NOT buy Even though this model has a solid design that, in our opinion, should fit most guards' playstyle like a glove, its heavier weight might be a total drawback for hoopers that rely on quick dribbles and footwork. So, just in case you're nodding whilst reading this, here you have the lightweight basketball shoes we've reviewed so far. Your browser does not support the video tag. Even though the Harden Vol. 9 offers a good grip, it is not as strong as you might expect from an expensive signature shoe. The D.O.N. Issue #6 and the Anthony Edwards 1 Low are both affordable Adidas shoes that offer much tackier traction. Cushioning Shock absorption New The Harden Vol. 9 proves that Adidas's renowned Boost foam doesn't have to be very thick to provide above-average impact protection. Its moderate heel stack showed a superior shock absorption score of 107 SA, keeping hard landings and heel-dominant strikes well cushioned. However, this Harden shoe doesn't feel as protective in the forefoot. With a low SA reading of 67, it is more about court feel and groundedness as opposed to shock attenuation under the ball of the boot. Heel Forefoot Test results Harden Vol. 9 107 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New The Boost also makes the Harden Vol. 9 feel consistently lively and springy from the heel to the toes. It's not as explosive as Nike's Zoom Air-powered shoes, but it shows above-average energy return in both the heel (62.1%) and the forefoot (63.1%). This Adidas shoe feels nice and dynamic for directional bursts and drives as well as rebounds and blocks. Heel Forefoot Test results Harden Vol. 9 63.1% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack Even though our caliper returned a moderate heel stack of 27.7 mm, we enjoyed the Harden Vol. 9's wonderful shock absorption and overall comfort. Test results Harden Vol. 9 27.7 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack At 20.3 mm, the forefoot stack of this Adidas shoe proved to be on par with the category average. It ensured good connection with the court while keeping the ball of foot and toe joints sufficiently protected. Test results Harden Vol. 9 20.3 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop After doing the math and measuring both stack heights, we noticed this hooper's drop is just average. At 7.4 mm, the heel doesn't feel crazy high, even though there's some extra cushioning on the rearfoot. Test results Harden Vol. 9 7.4 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. The Adidas Harden Vol. 9 features a full-length Boost foam which we found not only comfortable, but also quite snappy! And the best part is that this bouncy compound comes in a carrier Lightstrike foam. Your browser does not support the video tag. When we took the shoe to our lab and pressed our durometer against its cushioning, it returned 21.0 HA. As this result is lower than average, it means the foam used is on the softer side. Test results Harden Vol. 9 21.0 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Adidas Harden Vol. 9 fits true to size (21 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit Just by looking at its design, you can probably guess this is not the roomiest hooper ever. To know more about this, we poured our gel into the shoe and obtained a wonderful 1:1 mold. Your browser does not support the video tag. When we measured its widest part, our caliper showed 90.9 mm. This result is lower than average, and even though our standard feet (and ourselves, to be honest) didn't mind this snug fit, we can see wide-footed hoopers wishing there was some extra space. Test results Harden Vol. 9 90.9 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width This shoe tapers quite a lot, too. At only 65.3 mm, our toes didn't have any room to play or wiggle! That being said, we didn't feel our feet were too cramped to the point of discomfort during our wear tests. Test results Harden Vol. 9 65.3 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height Fortunately, the vertical height of the toebox is not that bad. At 24.3 mm, it's slightly higher than average. The thing is that the Harden Vol. 9 features a solid upper that needs some break-in, so don't worry if it's not the friendliest shoe at the beginning... it took us more than a couple of games to get used to it! Test results Harden Vol. 9 24.2 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New We were surprised to measure the Harden Vol. 9's friction score at just a moderate 0.70 after experiencing phenomenal traction in other signature shoes from Adidas like the D.O.N. Issue #6 (0.99) and the Anthony Edwards 1 Low (0.85). Don't get us wrong, the Vol. 9 still offers a solid grip on the court, ensuring hard stops and sharp cuts, but it's not the elite-level traction we expected from a shoe at this price point. Test results Harden Vol. 9 0.70 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New The shoe features a circular traction pattern and a double pivot point at the toe area and at the ball of the foot. What we liked the most about this design is that it follows the moves of basketball players with its round design and the perfect placement of the pivot points! Flexibility / Stiffness New The overall structure of this hooper is pretty stiff. Torsionally and longitudinally, the Harden Vol. 9 wasn't the one to agreeably bend alongside our feet from the very first moment we put it on. This Adidas shoe required an above-average force of 23.3N to bend in the forefoot This is totally understandable if we take into account its X-plate at the bottom. This stiff piece doesn't just offer some extra snappiness, it also makes the shoe harder to bend overall! But don't worry, it'll become more and more friendly with use. We didn't really need more than a couple of games for it to break-in. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Harden Vol. 9 23.3N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight The solid structure of this hooper is heavier than average. Its wonderful support and lockdown come with a price, which our scale marked at 14.60 oz/414g. We can't say it dragged our feet down during our wear tests, but it definitely doesn't feel like a fast shoe either. Test results Harden Vol. 9 14.6 oz (414g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability The Vol. 7 struggled a lot with ventilation, but luckily the Vol. 8 managed to fix it. Consequently, even though the Vol. 9 doesn't look like a breathing technique yoga teacher, we didn't lose hope! Your browser does not support the video tag. Well... the light test didn't really go well. But our smoke machine is here to solve our doubts, as it's where we really see if this hooper lets the hot air out or if it keeps it all inside! Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see in the video, the 7th iteration looks just as warm as it felt. The smoke couldn't get out, so this pair earned a 2/5 in breathability. On the other hand, we're really happy to say that this 9th model kept the high score on ventilation, as it got a solid 4/5 on this test. Despite its looks and the results of our light test, it proved it's more than willing to let your feet breathe. Our microscope showed us these key ventilation holes, as most of the smoke comes rushing through them from the inside. Sometimes shoes have them just as mere decoration, so we were really happy to see these were actually functional. Test results Harden Vol. 9 4 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Playing with this shoe on felt awesome: the amount of cushioning and support it features make its playability just fantastic! During our lateral stability test, we never felt unstable or uncomfortable. It's true that the top of the upper kind of dug a little bit on our ankles, yet its solid structure plus the bootie construction kept our feet right where they should be. Your browser does not support the video tag. That red piece you see right on top of the outsole is the shank. It contributes to the underfoot support and adds that extra snap to a hooper with an already bouncy foam! As you might guess, we were very pleased with it, as it improved our general experience on the court. Your browser does not support the video tag. Torsional rigidity The tall lateral walls didn't let our fingers bend the Harden Vol. 9. The structure gave in just a little bit, but enough for us to give it a 4/5 on our torsional rigidity test. That being said, the fact that this Adidas pair didn't get the highest score this one time doesn't mean that you'll get rid of its break-in period! Your browser does not support the video tag. The good thing here is that its lockdown feel and foot containment are both fantastic. We felt safe and sound during our playtests, and this bear hug-like fit is a constant that we've loved among all the Harden hoopers we've reviewed so far. Test results Harden Vol. 9 4 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness The bootie construction of this shoe, which imitates the Vol. 7 's and Vol. 8 's, made us completely forget about any kind of heel slippage. The Vol.9 features an extra padded and double counter that offered us wonderful support yet no heel rub! We checked this wonderful structure in our lab, and as it wasn't impossible hard for us to bend it, we decided to give it a 3/5 on stiffness. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Harden Vol. 9 3 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot Even though we didn't feel unstable when we went for a rebound in traffic or landing after a rough 2+1 jump shot, the Harden Vol. 9 has a narrower midsole. To our surprise, the calipers marked only 110.2 mm, which is lower than average. Nevertheless, in our experience, this didn't jeopardize stability. Test results Harden Vol. 9 110.2 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The midsole follows the same line at the heel, as it's also narrower than average. Our caliper marked 87.6 mm, and even though we don't see it as an important drawback, wider midsoles always improve stability. Test results Harden Vol. 9 87.6 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability At 5K RPM and with 2N of force, our Dremel went all in trying to destroy this Adidas' toebox. Contrary to what happens with most shoes, its fantastic score on breathability didn't take any durability points from it. It faced the tool bravely, so we've decided to give it a solid 4/5. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Harden Vol. 9 4 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability Despite its bootie-like construction, the Harden Vol. 9 has a quite durable heel. Once again, with the same 2N of force and at 5K RPM, the Dremel didn't manage to ruin its reputation on durability. In fact, we were so happy with the heel padding's performance that we decided to give it another 4/5. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Harden Vol. 9 4 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness We grabbed our durometer to check this Adidas' outsole hardness. Once we put it upside down, we pressed it against the rubber and waited patiently. At 83.5 HC, it's pretty much average, which means this hooper should offer a healthy mix of durability and traction. Test results Harden Vol. 9 83.5 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability With the same 2N of force but this time at 10K RPM, our Dremel drilled this shoe's outsole for a good 18 seconds. When we measured the damage left, our tread gauge returned 0.8 mm, which is lower than average. Your browser does not support the video tag. We're pretty happy with this score, as it means the Harden Vol. 9's outsole is made to last. Even though, personally, we wouldn't wear this hooper to play streetball, as its tread pattern is way too smooth, the durability of its rubber would let you easily play a game or two. Test results Harden Vol. 9 0.8 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness At 4.3 mm, this hooper's outsole is just as thick as the average of its category. Nevertheless, if we take into account how durable its rubber is, it's easy to understand why the brand didn't need to go for a bigger piece. That would've just made the whole shoe heavier... and that's a no! Test results Harden Vol. 9 4.3 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness Recently, we've seen Adidas using very standard insoles for its hoopers. It's not like we find it an issue or anything, though: you can always change these orthotics. In this case, it's 4.7 mm thick, which is just average, and it doesn't have any specific features to point out. Test results Harden Vol. 9 4.7 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole If you don't like the Harden Vol. 9's insole, you can always change it and use your own orthotics! Test results Harden Vol. 9 Yes Reflective elements The previous iterations didn't have any reflective elements, and the Vol. 9 hasn't changed that either. And speaking of change, we like how Adidas kept a very similar design for all the versions of this Harden hooper. Personally, we believe it brings this kind of \"I know what I'm getting\" and \"it doesn't disappoint\" feel that many hoopers might appreciate. Test results Harden Vol. 9 No Tongue padding When we measured the tongue area of the bootie-like design of this Adidas, our caliper returned 5.0 mm. We didn't experience any kind of lace bite or uncomfortable rubbing even if we played for hours, so we're pretty happy with this result! Test results Harden Vol. 9 5.0 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type As you can see in the picture below, the Harden Vol. 9 has a sock-like design. Even though putting it on is not as easy as it might be for other hoopers that feature a wider mouth, the containment and lockdown feel it offers is just fantastic. It's not just the double thick heel counter or the wrap-around fit, but as a knight in shiny armor (quite literally in this colorway, too), this shoe features a solid structure that hugs your feet comfortably and doesn't really give in. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Harden Vol. 9 Bootie Price The Harden Vol. 8 and Vol. 9 have the same PVP: $160. We were already head over heels in love with the 8, but we feel the 9 has doubled Cupido's arrow! It's as breathable but slightly more durable, yet the overall weight is lower. After our lab and wear tests, we can tell you that, in our opinion, we're talking about a solid performer that's absolutely worth its price. Test results Harden Vol. 9 $160 Average $135 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes $70 Price $210 Heel tab To help us put this Adidas pair on and off, there's a functional and convenient finger loop at the heel.

It keeps the same solid and trustworthy design, featuring a durable yet breathable structure that offers wonderful support and containment.

Nevertheless, despite being the lightest of their siblings, this hooper is still on the heavier side of its category. The solid lock-in feel and traction make this pair ideal for quick guards, but its weight might be a drawback."

The Fresh Foam BB v2 offers insane impact protection, and its structure is comfortable from the very first minute. Its upper is durable and very reinforced, so we could enjoy wonderful support during our games. This was also thanks to its double heel counter and its rubberized lateral walls, which wrapped around our feet comfortably. We believe one of the best selling points of this shoe is not just its solid traction even on dusty courts, but the fact that it protects your feet from any damage after jumping thanks to its shock-absorbing properties. We couldn't feel the court at all though, but we understand New Balance sacrificed that to offer the softest of landings.

A pair with fantastic shock absorption and grip to hoop for hours on end is what you need. You need a super comfortable basketball shoe with very good support. You're a center or more of a bigger/post-player! Who should NOT buy The Fresh Foam BB v2 focuses on comfort and protection, which implies loads of padding, cushioning, and reinforcement. Consequently, it's definitely not a light shoe! During our wear tests, we didn't feel it dragged our feet down like crazy, but we can assure you it doesn't feel like a couple of feathers either. That's why we believe this New Balance might be more suitable for bigger players/centers/post-players! If your playstyle relies on quick footwork, maybe you should have a look at our lightweight basketball shoe catalog . Your browser does not support the video tag. Just in the same way, all the impact protection and shock-absorbing properties of this hooper didn't let us feel the court under our feet during our wear tests. If you want to feel closer to the ground and you want to try New Balance basketball shoes, the Hesi Low might be exactly what you need! Cushioning Shock absorption New The max-cushioned goodness of this New Balance shoe offers top-tier impact protection even to the bigger players. With an exceptionally high shock absorption reading of 118 SA in the heel, the pillowy Fresh Foam makes each landing feel soft and safe. The BB v2 also feels amazingly protective for the toe joints and the ball of the foot, with an above-average shock attenuation of 96 SA in this area. Heel Forefoot Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 118 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New The shoe's Fresh Foam midsole absorbs a ton of impact upon landing but doesn't bounce much of it back at the toe-off. With its modest energy return measurements, the BB v2 doesn't feel particularly lively or propulsive. But on the bright side, it offers a highly stable platform which is ideal for post play and bigger guys who prefer a sense of control underfoot. Heel Forefoot Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 54.8% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack At 34.9 mm, this shoe's heel stack is significantly higher than average. As you can see, our caliper had to open wide before it could fit such a big chunk of foam between its claws! Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 34.9 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack The forefoot followed the same scheme, as our caliper indicated that it's also higher than average at 25.6 mm. What we liked the most about this is that the Fresh Foam BB v2 doesn't forget about the forefoot. Like, you know, there are many times when shoes are incredibly cushioning at the heel, but not so much at the ball of the foot. In this case, New Balance made sure we felt safe landing with any part of our feet. Your browser does not support the video tag. One of the reasons why we appreciated this a lot was that, when you've been hooping for a while, you start falling using just your forefoot (as far as possible). This protects your knees and lets you regain balance sooner, so we believe getting some extra cushioning in that area is a fantastic choice. Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 25.6 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop Despite having a higher forefoot, the Fresh Foam BB v2 doesn't have a very low drop. At 9.3 mm, it's definitely higher than average. Nevertheless, we didn't feel anything different when we walked or ran with the shoe. In other words, we didn't have to get used to it or readjust our foot to its ride. Your browser does not support the video tag. Now that we have a full visual of this New Balance's interior, let's talk about it. The shoe features a full-length and dual-density Fresh Foam X midsole, which feels incredibly soft (as we'll verify in the next section) and comfortable. It also has a TPU shank in the midfoot that offers that little bit of bounce, even though we didn't feel it much. Just by looking at how padded the interiors of this shoe are and feeling how soft its midsole is, there's no doubt: The Fresh Foam BB v2 is all about comfort and support. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 9.3 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. As we had already hinted, this shoe's midsole is clearly on the softer side. Your browser does not support the video tag. Our durometer returned just 13.1 HA when we measured it, and trust us, our feet could tell! Also, this shoe is comfortable right out of the box, which is something we love as it lets us just go play ball straight away. In other words, if you're not a fan of break-in periods, the Fresh Foam BB v2 is a fantastic choice! Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 13.1 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size New Balance Fresh Foam BB v2 fits slightly small (22 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit New Balance never skimps on toebox space and offers alternative widths if you need even more room! This proved to be true for the Fresh Foam BB v2's fit as well. Your browser does not support the video tag. We created a replica of the shoe's interiors using proprietary gel and measured its dimensions with a caliper. In the widest part of the mold, the tool returned an above-average reading of 92.3 mm. Even though it is within the medium-width range, it feels somewhat roomier (and great!). New test (recommended) Old test Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 92.3 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width There is no aggressive tapering in the shoe's toebox and its rounded shape was reflected in a wider reading of 72.3 mm near the big toe. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 72.3 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height We didn't feel any pressure on top of our toes either as the NB Fresh Foam BB v2 has an ample toebox height of 25.2 mm. Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 25.2 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New Strong and consistent - that's how we would describe the grip of this New Balance shoe! With an above-average friction score of 0.77, it has excellent stopping power in all directions, making cuts and direction changes quick and effortless. Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 0.77 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New The circular tread pattern of the Fresh Foam BB v2 pulls cues from the original Fresh Foam BB because why change something that works so wonderfully! Flexibility / Stiffness New Even with its tough and stiff materials, we found that the Fresh Foam BB v2 requires just as much force to bend as the average basketbal shoe. With a standard flex machine reading of 20.5N, the shoe offered a mix of stability and smooth transitions on the court. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 20.5N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight Before we start talking about the real weight of this shoe, there's something we would like to clarify: the Fresh Foam BB v2 is not a fast hooper. Your browser does not support the video tag. Its design and structure focus on being incredibly comfortable and protective, and after our own experience playing basketball with this pair, we can totally confirm it. It just doesn't feel quick on foot, and maybe guards with fast footwork will find it a bit too slow for their liking. When we took it to our lab, the scale returned 14.1 oz/400g, which is already more than average. And we could feel this during our wear tests, that's for sure. Nevertheless, this weight didn't stop us or make our feet feel too tired. Your browser does not support the video tag. The Fresh Foam BB v2 might not be as leg-saving as other lightweight hoopers, but as we mentioned before, it doesn't feel like the brand was specifically aiming for that. These kicks focus on making your feet comfy and happy, so they're definitely not the fastest hoopers around. Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 14.1 oz (400g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability This New Balance felt like a couple of mini-ovens in our feet during our wear tests. When we took it to our lab to see what was going on, we started by checking its upper against a light to see if it had any ventilation holes. Your browser does not support the video tag. Well, there wasn't even one! The only place where we saw them was in the tongue. Should we ask our smoke machine if that's actually enough to let the air in and out? Your browser does not support the video tag. Okay, that was... sad. The poor Fresh Foam BB v2 paled in comparison with the super breathable Curry 10 . Not even a little bit of smoke came out, it just felt as if the New Balance pair literally just sighed at the very end of our test! That's why we gave the Curry 10 a perfect 5/5 and the Fresh Foam BB v2... just a 1/5 on our breathability test. This shoe features a tight mesh upper with suede overlays that reinforce the whole structure. Even though you might associate the word \"mesh\" with breathability, trust us... this isn't the case! Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 1 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Even though we've already mentioned it before, we can't get tired of saying how supportive this New Balance felt on our feet. We believe this is thanks to its upper overlays and reinforcements, as well as its padding, as they didn't let our ankles play around much. Your browser does not support the video tag. This translated into feeling confident and safe on the court, which is honestly something priceless! It made us go for more aggressive moves, as this shoe wasn't that quick for us to try very fast footwork. In our opinion, the Fresh Foam BB v2 is a great pair for centers and players who post-play a lot. It might not be the best for guards who create openings through dribble penetration, but we believe it suits hoopers who usually play closer to the zone. Torsional rigidity The tough upper materials aren't the only ones that offer such wonderful support. The Fresh Foam BB v2 features really high rubberized lateral walls that held our feet in place during our games. When we took this shoe to our lab, we could clearly see it when we performed our torsional rigidity test. Do you want to see our fingers struggle for 6 seconds straight? Well then, here we go. Your browser does not support the video tag. Just look at that, we couldn't bend this New Balance even if we tried our hardest! Consequently, we've decided to give it a well-deserved 5/5 on our torsional rigidity test. Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness We also tried to push and bend the heel counter of the Fresh Foam BB v2, and even though it wasn't as impossible as twisting its whole structure, we can't say it was pure play dough either. Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see, the sides and the top of the area of the Achilles obliged, nevertheless, from the middle part of the heel counter down, the material fought back a little bit more. Why? Well, it's because this shoe features a TPU external and internal heel counter. But this structure doesn't make it all the way up to the tip of the collar, it stays in the middle more or less. We didn't experience any kind of heel slippage, and this structure makes the heel counter comfortable enough. In other words, it didn't hurt our Achilles at all, not even during our very first games! Your browser does not support the video tag. After taking all this into account, we've decided to give this shoe a 3/5 on our heel counter stiffness test. Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 3 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot When we measured this shoe's midsole width in the forefoot and our caliper returned 114.4 mm, we realized it was pretty much average. It's clearly not the widest landing base we've seen in our lab, but we didn't find it too narrow or unstable at all during our wear tests. Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 114.4 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel On the other hand, the midsole width in the heel is slightly higher than average at 92.3 mm. We appreciated this, as it means the rearfoot gets some extra stability points! But it's not something that made a huge difference between this New Balance pair and other hoopers. We'd say it's more like a nice little touch than a game-changing feature. Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 92.3 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability In exchange for the breathability, this New Balance hooper did its best to protect its upper. And it succeeded! Your browser does not support the video tag. We saw it fight bravely against our Dremel, and when we checked the damage dealt, we couldn't help but smile! Just look at that! Even though we went for the weakest part of the shoe, it survived perfectly well. As you can see in the picture, there's a big suede overlay on the outside, which is basically what's going to be protecting not only your feet, but also the whole shoe from any damage. Additionally, this gives structure to the hooper, enhancing its footlocking levels. But we'll talk about that later on! For now, look at the shoe on the right. That's the Nike Precision 6 and its messed up upper. We could only give it a terrifying 1/5 on our toebox durability test. And after this comparison, you can probably understand why the Fresh Foam BB v2 got a fantastic 4/5 on this same test! Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 4 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability We expected the heel padding to follow the same path, and even though it was a bit weaker, we can't say we're unsatisfied with the result. Your browser does not support the video tag. Our Dremel went all in once again but during 5 seconds, and the super plush heel of the Fresh Foam BB v2 did suffer a little bit. The tool gave this shoe's heel padding some crazy morning hair, and it has scored a 3/5 on our durability test. If we compare it with the Reebok Answer DMX and its 1/5 on this same test, that grade doesn't sound so bad any more, huh? Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 3 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness When our durometer returned 87.9 HC as soon as we pressed it against this shoe's outsole, we realized this softie had some tough sides to it! This result is higher than average, which usually indicates the rubber compound used in the outsole focuses on being durable. Sometimes this means that grip stays as a secondary character. Nevertheless, and without wanting to massively spoil anything, we want to tell you one thing: the Fresh Foam BB v2 is a traction BEAST. Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 87.9 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability Our Dremel had one last chance to redeem itself and show us how much of a shoe eater it can be. Your browser does not support the video tag. Now at 10K RPM and with 3.2N of force, the tool attacked this New Balance's outsole during 22 seconds. We patiently waited, seeing how all the rubber dust accumulated right next to the dent. And we were really happy with the result! Once we put the tool aside, we could barely see the damage on the outsole. When we measured it with our tread gauge, it returned 0.7 mm, which is a wonderful score! This means the Fresh Faom BB v2 features a durable outsole that should be by your side for a long time. Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 0.7 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness As the rubber compound used in the outsole is pretty long-lasting, we didn't think the brand would go for a very chunky outsole. To verify this, we grabbed our caliper and measured it, once we had cut the shoe in half. It returned 3.7 mm, which is lower than average. We totally agree with the brand's decision, as it helps reduce the overall shoe weight! Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 3.7 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness Its crazy soft and comfy bottom doesn't really need a very thick insole, or at least that's how we see it. When we removed this shoe's insole and measured it with our caliper, we realized New Balance totally agreed with us. At 4.9 mm, its thickness is just average, and honestly, we wouldn't change that. After our wear tests, we can say that you feel pretty far off the ground in this hooper, which might lead to feeling slightly unstable. If the brand had used a thicker insole, our feet would've been even more separated from the court! Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 4.9 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole As expected from New Balance, the Fresh Foam BB v2 features a removable insole! In other words, you can change it whenever you need to. As its heel says, it's a Fresh Foam insole. We found it incredibly comfortable, and even though all this bottom cushioning and softness didn't let us feel the court under our feet, if you prioritize impact protection, this is the shoe for you! Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 Yes Reflective elements This hooper doesn't have any reflective elements at all! Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 No Tongue padding We found this shoe's tongue padding enough to protect our feet from lace bite or any other kind of uncomfortable rub in our instep. This is probably another measure New Balance took to reduce this hooper's overall weight, which is a much needed strategy! Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 5.1 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type The brand went for a non-gusseted tongue in the Fresh Foam BB v2. We were quite surprised, as the previous version featured a fully gusseted one! But... its predecessor was also lighter (at 13.9 oz/394g), so we can understand why New Balance made this decision. Test results Fresh Foam BB v2 None Heel tab The Fresh Foam BB v2 doesn't have a heel tab, but as its tongue is non-gusseted, we had plenty of space to slide our feet on without any problems.

An energetic and bouncy companion that will shield you from harsh impacts when you're determined to get that rebound is what you need. You're looking for a partner to play streetball from time to time that bites the court consistently. You need a versatile basketball shoe because you love changing positions when you play ball. Who should NOT buy If you don't want to risk having to deal with a break-in period, maybe you'd like to have a look at a shoe that's comfortable right out of the box. You might not want to change brands, so what about checking the New Balance Fresh Foam BB V2 out? It feels like a soft cloud underfoot! Your browser does not support the video tag. You might not be a huge fan of massive soles, though. If we've just hit the spot, the New Balance Hesi Low is a great option, as it will let you feel the court under your feet. Last but not least, we want to tell you that this V5 doesn't stand a huge jump away from the V4. In other words, the changes are not otherworldly, so you might not want to spend more money for little updates when the New Balance TWO WXY V4 is out there on sale! Cushioning Shock absorption New New Balance mixes two of its best cushioning foams for the TWO WXY V5's midsole. A softer FuelCell foam in the forefoot showed above-average shock absorption of 88 SA. This is great news for ballers who can sacrifice some court feel for the added impact protection in the ball of foot area. A thick slab of Fresh Foam in the heel also returned a great shock absorption score of 101 SA. However, it wasn't nearly as cushioned as the same foam in the New Balance BB v2 , with a whopping measurement of 118 SA! Bigger players and folks who need as much comfort and joint protection as they can get might prefer the latter for that reason. Heel Forefoot Test results TWO WXY V5 101 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New The TWO WXY V5 will keep your landings safe and sound but it won't launch you off the court so sprightly. While it feels decently responsive, the cushioning setup of this New Balance shoe is not a very propulsive one and certainly falls short of the rebound offered by the best hoop shoes from Swoosh . Our energy return test recorded moderate measurements of 47.9% in its heel and 55% in the forefoot. Heel Forefoot Test results TWO WXY V5 55.0% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack With a heel stack of 32.4 mm, this NB feels really comfortable and soft underfoot. Test results TWO WXY V5 32.4 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack The forefoot stack stands at 23.0 mm, so it's higher than average too. Test results TWO WXY V5 23.0 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop After measuring the heel and the forefoot stacks of this NB, we've calculated it has a drop of 9.4 mm. This means the position of the heel is slightly higher than where the toes rest. But it's not like our feet felt the difference: as both parts have plenty of cushioning, we just felt protected from the harsh surfaces. Test results TWO WXY V5 9.4 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. The TWO WXY V5's midsole features two different foams. As we've mentioned before, in the heel it has Fresh Foam, which focuses on impact protection. When we studied it, our durometer returned 21.5 HA, which makes it slightly softer than average. Your browser does not support the video tag. This shoe feels really comfortable and soft underfoot. Its foams made sure we enjoyed every jump during our wear tests, and the shank we mentioned before offered us really good support (alongside the general structure) in every landing. Test results TWO WXY V5 21.5 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Secondary foam softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. But the FuelCell foam at the forefoot turned out to be even softer! With a durometer measurement of 14.5 HA, it is significantly softer than the Fresh Foam as well as the average basketball shoe foam softness. Test results TWO WXY V5 14.5 HA Average 27.8 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Size and fit Size New Balance TWO WXY V5 fits true to size (26 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit The TWO WXY V5 offers a pretty generous fit for a D medium width shoe. Your browser does not support the video tag. Having retrieved a mold of the shoe's interiors, we measured its widest area at 93.7 mm. This is somewhat roomier than average, but players with wide feet can get even more room by ordering the shoe's wide version. New test (recommended) Old test Test results TWO WXY V5 93.7 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width The mold also showed how rounded and non-tapered the shoe's toebox shape is. Our caliper recorded an above-average width of 71.2 mm near the big toe. New test (recommended) Old test Test results TWO WXY V5 71.2 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height We expect no toe restriction from the top of the shoe either. Its toebox height returned a standard reading of 26.8 mm on our caliper. Test results TWO WXY V5 26.8 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New You can expect a very surefooted experience in the TWO WXY V5. This NB shoe returned a solid coefficient of friction (0.74) in our grip test and proved to be on par with the category average. It's not the tackiest hoop shoe in our catalog, but it feels adaptable without being too sticky. Test results TWO WXY V5 0.74 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New Just like the Fresh Foam BB v2 , the TWO WXY V5 features New Balance's unique circular traction pattern. Its oddly shaped concentric circles provide a stronger multi-directional bite thanks to the suction-cup-like effect they create. Flexibility / Stiffness New Despite its very high torsional rigidity, the TWO WXY V5 surprised us with a pretty low reading on a flexibility testing machine! Requiring only 14.0N to bend in the forefoot, it proved to be significantly more pliable than the category average. We could feel this when we ran up and down the court. The shoe bent easily alongside our feet, following their every move. The fact that it's pliable in this specific area is also very convenient if you usually go for fakes. Stiffer pairs might be more complicated to smoothly follow your intentions from minute one, but this NB was ready to fool our defender with us! New test (recommended) Old test Test results TWO WXY V5 14.0N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight As we were saying, the TWO WXY V5 didn't feel heavy or too bulky on foot. It's definitely not the quickest hooper out there, but we could go for quick cuts, fast breaks, and explosive layups during our playtests with no problem. It really kept up! When we took it to our lab, our scale marked 13.8 oz/390.0g, which is an average score. For a hooper with this amount of inner padding, we believe it's a pretty good weight! Your browser does not support the video tag. Overall, it feels great on foot. Running up and down the court was easy, and thanks to the wonderful containment and lock-in feel, defending guards on this shoe just felt right. Test results TWO WXY V5 13.8 oz (390g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability There are 3 tools we needed in order to perform our breathability test properly: a light, our smoke machine, and the microscope. We started putting the cut-in-half part of the TWO WXY V5 right in front of the light to see if it had any ventilation holes in its upper. Nevertheless, as you can see in the video below, shining through such thick material was impossible. Your browser does not support the video tag. This leads us to the second step, where we fill up the whole shoe with smoke and wait to see where and how it comes out. In this case, we're using the Air Jordan XXXIX to compare results. As our tests are standardized, we get to do this with every pair we buy. How cool is that! Your browser does not support the video tag. Alright, so... it's not like the New Balance model is crazy breathable, but did let out a fair amount of smoke pretty consistently. In comparison with the lowest 1/5 the AJ took home, we've decided to give the TWO WXY V5 an average 3/5. Which is not bad at all! There seem to be gaps with fewer layers, but the material used for the upper is pretty thick, so of course the light couldn't get through! Test results TWO WXY V5 3 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test The lateral stability of this NB was just something else. Your browser does not support the video tag. Look at just how little our ankles can overextend themselves! We felt the structure of the TWO WXY V5 offered our feet wonderful containment. Additionally, the upper features an extra eyelet at the top just in case you want to go for the runner's knot. Overall, this pair provided us with lots of balance and stability, as well as a fantastic lockdown feel. On the court, this translated into fearless quick cuts, jab steps, and strong reverse pivoting. As you might have noticed, the moves we've just mentioned don't belong to one specific position. For example, even though it's usually guards who go for jab steps, it's centres who focus on pivoting! So, why did we mix it all up? Well, because the TWO WXY V5 is a really versatile shoe. On New Balance's official webpage, it comes tagged as \"positionless\", which means every position will benefit from its advantages. Your browser does not support the video tag. All in all, and after trying it out during our wear tests, we can assure you we couldn't agree more. This hooper's adaptability is off the roof, so no matter what position you play, it'll most likely be a great companion. Torsional rigidity As expected after our lateral stability test, our fingers struggled a lot trying to twist this shoe, so we decided to give it a 5/5 on our torsional rigidity test. Your browser does not support the video tag. The big rubberized wall acted like an armor, and even though we tried to get past it, its protection prevented the TWO WXY V5 from bending at our will. During our wear tests, this translated into great support, stability, and, most importantly, safety. You know, when shoes get a high score on this test, it most likely means their materials are too rigid at the beginning, which leads to a required break-in period. In our personal opinion, this initial effort is totally worth it, as it means we'll feel confident playing in them due to its wonderful containment. Test results TWO WXY V5 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness The heel counter was a little bit too rough on our feet. Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see, it was impossible for our fingers to make it bow to us, so we've given it the 5/5 on stiffness it deserves. It stood its ground firmly, and even though its structure does offer our heel a lot of support, its stiffness was also harsh to our feet at the beginning. Test results TWO WXY V5 5 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot To improve its overall stability even more, the TWO WXY V5 features a wider-than-average landing base. Our caliper returned 116.6 mm when we measured the midsole width in the forefoot, which means our feet and toes had enough space to stretch and readapt themselves when we were back to the court after jumping for a rebound. Test results TWO WXY V5 116.6 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The heel has an even bigger difference in comparison with the average. At 94.6 mm, it's a solid 5% wider than the typical score in this category. This might not sound like much, but trust us, every mm counts! Test results TWO WXY V5 94.6 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability Even though there's a protective layer right around the toes, we always put our Dremel on the very same spot so we can compare every shoe in a fair way. And, in this case, it just didn't get the chance to defend this area from the tool. Your browser does not support the video tag. We really panicked when we saw all those blue threads flying around. Were we gonna have to face a massive hole? Would the Dremel destroy the material completely? Should we say bye-bye to this shoe's integrity? Thankfully, nothing of that happened! The damage was considerable, though, just not big enough for us to give it a lower grade. So the TWO WXY V5 ended up with a 3/5 on our toebox durability test. Test results TWO WXY V5 3 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability This super padded heel just had a 4-second nightmare when our Dremel went all in to try and ruin it. Your browser does not support the video tag. The tool ate up the area, leaving an ugly hole behind. We just couldn't give this New Balance anything higher than a 1/5. Look at the picture below, you'll definitely agree with us! Test results TWO WXY V5 1 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness We pressed our durometer against this shoe's outsole to measure its hardness, and it returned 80.0 HC. This clean result is also average, which means the TWO WXY V5 should offer a healthy mix of durability and grip. But this is just our hypothesis, so let's see if our upcoming tests agree! Test results TWO WXY V5 80.0 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability As we expected, the rubber outsole of this NB showed us good durability. Even though we tried to ruin it with our Dremel for 22 seconds at 10K RPM and with 3.2N of force, it put up a fight! Your browser does not support the video tag. Once we were done, our tread gauge measured the damages. It returned 1.0 mm, which is average, so we can't complain! Playing streetball from time to time in this shoe shouldn't be a problem, but it you overuse it in harsh surfaces like outdoor concrete courts, it might leave your side sooner than you'd want it to. Test results TWO WXY V5 1.0 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness Its 4.6 mm thick outsole helped us decide if this NB pair was okay to play outdoors. As it's thicker than average, we believe it should last more than a couple of games! Even though this also adds some extra weight to the shoe, and not just durability, we didn't feel it was bottom-heavy at all. In fact, it was more like we felt quick in it! Nothing crazy, but it's a nice pro to point out. Test results TWO WXY V5 4.6 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness A thicker-than-average 5.6 mm insole was waiting for our feet inside this NB. It felt nice and cushioned. Our feet sure loved their new bed! Test results TWO WXY V5 5.6 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole We love New Balance's insoles, but if you have a different taste or you need to use your own orthotics, don't worry. The TWO WXY V5 features a removable insole! Test results TWO WXY V5 Yes Reflective elements No reflective elements here. If you play streetball at night, make sure to be safe and in lighted areas! Test results TWO WXY V5 No Tongue padding This shoe's tongue is thicker than average at 12.5 mm, which made our insteps feel really comfortable. It features two foam layers that made sure lace bite was totally out of the way! Test results TWO WXY V5 12.5 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type A semi-gusseted and nicely padded tongue held our feet in place. We believe the brand outdid itself with this choice, as it let us have the best of both worlds. First, it offers extra support and containment, which is a key point in this shoe. And then, the fact that the tongue is tied to the upper using an elastic band leaves a big gap towards the upper, which definitely improves breathability. Test results TWO WXY V5 Both sides (semi) Price After analyzing this shoe deeply, we can say it offers a whole lot of advantages for a very reasonable price. Nevertheless, it's quite similar to the previous iteration, which we believe you might find way cheaper now that this new version is out. The TWO WXY V5 is definitely an improvement in comparison with the V4 , that's for sure. But, is it worth it to go for the latest version when the previous shoe is so similar and on sale right now? Well, that's for you to decide! Test results TWO WXY V5 $120 Average $135 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes $70 Price $210 Heel tab Instead of having a finger loop or any detail along those lines, the TWO WXY V5 features an extended heel collar. This piece doesn't only help to put the shoe on, it also offered some extra support to our heels during our wear tests!

We felt we could reach the skies just like Jordan did thanks to the incredible bounce and energy return we felt every time we played. This also made the shoe incredibly comfortable, shielding us from the harsh court when we jumped. Nevertheless, the explosion of energy we felt on our feet was totally and dangerously uncontrolled. So, even though we found this AJ amazing for static shooting drills, it's too unstable for us to play comfortably quick with it.

An incredibly comfortable shoe that will shield your feet from impact. A new partner for your static shooting drills. Who should NOT buy After comparing our personal experiences during our wear tests, we've agreed this AJ feels really unstable on foot. Its midsole is super explosive, but the shoe itself doesn't include any kind of stopping mechanism (like stability features) so going for powerful layups or quick cuts felt too dangerous. This ended up making our ankles and feet muscles work so much, that they ended up really tired once we were done playing. As an alternative, we believe you could try the incredibly supportive Jordan Luka 2 , or the Nike G.T. Jump 2 , which also has an incredibly powerful energy return. Your browser does not support the video tag. If these pairs are too pricey for you, you can always play with our filters and select cheaper hoopers! Here you have the cheapest ones we've analyzed to far. Cushioning Shock absorption New The use of Nike's most advanced ZoomX superfoam brings basketball shoe cushioning to a whole new level! Measuring the impact that the XXXIX's midsole can attenuate, we recorded an exceptionally high reading of 118 SA in the heel. And the fact that its forefoot showed just a standard shock absorption of 84 SA didn't make this Air Jordan shoe any less comfortable. It is some of the best-cushioned hoop shoes that feel very easy on the feet and joints and fight off fatigue for all four quarters. Heel Forefoot Test results Air  XXXIX 118 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New The winning combination of ZoomX foam and Zoom Air units brings the explosiveness of Nike's top-tier running shoes to the basketball court. Expect the XXXIX to feel like an actual bounce castle with an above-average energy return of 67.8% in the heel and a whopping 74.9% in the forefoot! This shoe makes each step feel incredibly charged, but unfortunately, it comes at the price of stability. Heel Forefoot Test results Air  XXXIX 74.9% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack Measuring the heel stack of this Jordan, our caliper returned 27.1 mm. But the fact that this shoe has a lower heel stack compared to the average does NOT mean the cushioning is worse! In fact, it's completely the opposite: the Air Jordan XXXIX felt unbelievably comfortable and soft underfoot. Test results Air  XXXIX 27.1 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack The forefoot stack goes down the same road with a moderate caliper reading of 19.9 mm. But once again, we never felt like this AJ lacked comfort or protection. Test results Air  XXXIX 19.9 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop Both these measures leave us with a drop of 7.2 mm, which is pretty much average. The heel is only moderately elevated above the toes. Test results Air  XXXIX 7.2 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. With all the comfort we experienced playing in the AJ XXXIX, we weren't even a little bit surprised when our durometer marked 16.5 HA. It is some of the softest measurements we recorded among basketball shoe foams. You see, it just combines Nike's ZoomX premium foam with a full Air Unit, so it basically feels like flying and then landing on clouds. Your browser does not support the video tag. Nevertheless, as we specify on our ultimate guide about foams, the major drawback of the ZoomX is its durability. Consequently, what you feel the first days you're playing in this shoe compared to some time later on (just depending on how much you play per day) will be totally different. The same equation works if you change the unknowns. Take a heavier player, for example, and change it for the extra time played. That added weight on the midsole will definitely make the ZoomX wear out sooner if we compare it with its use by a lighter player. Alright, with all this being said, we gotta admit this setup looks and feels wonderful comfort-wise. Nevertheless, if we focus on the stability provided... Nike, why on Earth didn't you add a shank!? It was just as simple as adding a couple of stability features, and you would have one of the craziest hoopers of the year. So... what happened in there? Your browser does not support the video tag. Well, in our opinion, the fact that the AJ XXXIX doesn't have a shank jeopardized its playability from top to bottom. During our wear tests, when we went for aggressive cuts or quick lateral moves, our feet didn't seem to find the right balance. Let us say it straight: to us, this shoe felt unstable. Test results Air  XXXIX 16.5 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Air Jordan XXXIX fits true to size (53 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit The AJ XXXIX treated our feet to a pretty accommodating fit in a D medium width. The same was also confirmed by our precise measurements of the shoe's gel mold. Your browser does not support the video tag. Having created a replica of the shoe's interiors using proprietary gel, we measured its widest area at 94.7 mm. This is slightly above the average and feels comfortably non-restricting on foot. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Air  XXXIX 94.7 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width The mold also revealed the shoe's slightly rounded toebox shape which showed an above-average width of 72.6 mm near the big toe. A non-pointy toebox like this eliminates the risk of toe jamming or numbing. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Air  XXXIX 72.6 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height This basketball shoe should not aggravate any painful toenail conditions either with its ample space above the toes. Our caliper returned a standard toebox height of 24.0 mm. Test results Air  XXXIX 24.0 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New Sliding the XXXIX's forefoot against a piece of pro court surface, we recorded a solid friction coefficient of 0.77. This implies a very adaptable and reliable grip for various on-court situations. Test results Air  XXXIX 0.77 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New This Air Jordan shoe features a translucent rubber outsole with a herringbone tread pattern which is optimized for indoor courts. However, we found it too soft and thin for abrasive blacktops. Flexibility / Stiffness New Given the lack of rigid components in this Jordan shoe, we didn't expect to see a high reading on our flex testing machine. Even a sightly below-average reading of 19.3N surprised us because this hoop shoe is definitely more about comfort than it is about the snappiness and support associated with stiffer shoes. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Air  XXXIX 19.3N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight Following our experience playing basketball in this newest AJ during our wear tests, we can't say it's the most nimble shoe out there, but it doesn't feel heavy either. As our scale stated when we went back to our lab, a weight of 13.9 oz/394.0g is just average. That's why this shoe felt neither like ballast nor like a couple of feathers when we ran up and down the court. Your browser does not support the video tag. The thing is... those times when we had to run because of some crazy fast break, we didn't really feel stable in the shoe. Listen, it even got to the point where stopping in the blink of an eye and changing directions felt rather unsafe for us. Test results Air  XXXIX 13.9 oz (394g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability After playing basketball for a while with this shoe during our wear tests, we could feel our feet begging for air. The more we played, the hotter things got, and our toes ended up almost swimming because of how much we were sweating! To check this in the lab, we started with our light test. We put a cut part of our upper right in front of our light, but none of it could actually get through its material. Like, at all. Your browser does not support the video tag. So we decided to try using our smoke machine. We pumped smoke into the non-cut shoe to see how much of it would stay inside, and if it left the shoe, at what speed and from where. Your browser does not support the video tag. When we saw this, we had to recheck if our machine was on. What do you mean there's literally NO smoke coming through the upper!? Not even a shy little column, nothing! We couldn't believe our eyes, but with this clear as crystal demonstration, we didn't even need to compare the results of this Air Jordan to the Curry 10 's, which scored a perfect 5/5 on this test. Our microscope close-up might be showing us holes. But, as usual, many of them have layers underneath that don't let the air go in and out easily. Additionally, this leather material is not made to let feet breathe happily. After this underwhelming performance, we have given the Air Jordan XXXIX a 1/5 on our breathability test. And trust us, if we could give it a 0 or a -1, we really would! Test results Air  XXXIX 1 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test In terms of lateral stability... there's pretty much none on the Air Jordan XXXIX. Your browser does not support the video tag. As we mentioned a couple of sections before, this shoe feels really unstable. During our wear tests, we had to be extra careful when we stopped suddenly, so back-door cuts literally felt like a threat. One way to put it is that we felt as if there was nothing there to stop our feet from overextending every move. After thinking about it and comparing experiences, we believe that's why our feet were so tired after playing. Ankles and all! You know, the soft and bouncy midsole of this AJ is like a limitless power source, and there was nothing to stop its energy from being dangerous but our own feet. So our muscles and joints had to make an extra effort that, in other pairs with stability features, might not be as necessary. Torsional rigidity The rubber walls made us give this shoe a 4/5 on our torsional rigidity test. Your browser does not support the video tag. Nevertheless, it's not hard rubber. It does make it hard for our fingers to twist it, but the experience on foot is different. That's why we believe it's really important to test every single pair in and outside our lab! There are other hoopers that feature tough materials or specific details in order to improve lateral stability (like the Jordan Luka 2 , for example). These pairs usually get a 5/5 on this same test, but the thing is that our hands and our feet feel the same: protection! In the case of the AJ XXXIX, even though our fingers struggled to bend it, our feet felt they could collapse at any moment. Test results Air  XXXIX 4 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness We couldn't rely on the heel counter for support either. Your browser does not support the video tag. Its padded structure bent easily when we pushed it during our manual test, and the shoe doesn't feature an internal or external plastic (or any other stiff material) piece to add stability. Test results Air  XXXIX 3 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot After everything we've said about the lack of stability and balance, you might be thinking: \"Ah well, maybe Nike went for a wide landing base to try to compensate for the lack of supportive elements\". Well, we're sorry to tell you this, but... you couldn't be more wrong. At 110.9 mm, this shoe's midsole width in the forefoot is narrower than average. So, bad news! Test results Air  XXXIX 110.9 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel But it gets even worse at the heel, where our caliper returned only 85.7 mm. Even though this is only 5% less wide than average, trust us, it means a lot. The narrow design of the midsole at the rearfoot has a negative effect on the overall stability of the shoe. We're not saying this AJ's problem could be fixed just by having a wider platform, but it would definitely help. Test results Air  XXXIX 85.7 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability We're not gonna lie here, we did expect a great result in durability in exchange for that poor ventilation we just witnessed. So, we grabbed our Dremel and got the party started! Your browser does not support the video tag. Rolling around at a speed of 5K RPM and with 3.2N of force, we saw white material flying around pretty soon into the test. Nevertheless, all this time analyzing shoes has taught us not to despair until we see the final results. Alright, so this is what the shoe looks like after the Dremel's attack. As you can see, the tool couldn't just get through this shoe's thick leather layer completely. Still, the damage shouldn't be taken lightly, as it's not a mere scratch! In conclusion, we have decided it deserves a solid 4/5 on our toebox durability test. Test results Air  XXXIX 4 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability Just by looking at it, we can say the heel is pretty padded. But don't let this trick you! Sometimes, extra padding doesn't mean more durability. Your browser does not support the video tag. We turned on our Dremel again at 5K RPM and with 3.2N of force to attack this shoe for 4 seconds non-stop. Despite the amount of padding, we felt the damage was significant. Just not so much to actually raise concerns, at least in our opinion, but taking into account the constant rubbing basketball shoes have to endure in the heel... we expected a slightly better performance. This is the final result. It looks pretty messy honestly, so we have decided to give it a 3/5 on our heel padding durability test. Test results Air  XXXIX 3 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness Our durometer returned 79.0 HC when we pressed it against the outsole. We believe this result indicates this AJ will offer a fantastic mix of durability and grip. But hey, we have specific tests to verify that, so stay tuned! Test results Air  XXXIX 79.0 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability We gave our Dremel one last time to shine when we checked this shoe's outsole durability. Your browser does not support the video tag. This time at 10K RPM, the tool drilled the rubber for what must've been the longest 22 seconds of this Air Jordan's life. Once the test was over, we grabbed our tread gauge to check how deep the dent was. It might be a little bit hard to see, but the measuring tool returned 0.9 mm, which is a pretty good score. Even though this shoe might not be the best to play streetball, its outsole can definitely handle a couple of games easily! Test results Air  XXXIX 0.9 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness After checking the durability of the rubber used in the outsole, we were not surprised to see our caliper marking 3.0 mm when we measured the thickness of said part. Consequently, even though this figure is lower than average, we weren't worried about its lifespan at all! Test results Air  XXXIX 3.0 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness With such an incredibly comfortable midsole, who needs an extra padded insole? That's what we believe crossed Nike's mind. Nevertheless, the brand still went for a quite thick piece! Our caliper returned 4.4 mm, which is pretty much average. Even though a thinner insole would have reduced the overall weight of this AJ slightly, we really can't complain. Test results Air  XXXIX 4.4 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole A removable insole! Yes! We loved that the brand decided to include a tag with the name of this shoe! But there's something that we like even more, and that's the fact that you can swap the standard insole of the AJ XXXIX and go for one that offers some more support! This won't solve all the stability issues, but it'll definitely give you a hand. Test results Air  XXXIX Yes Reflective elements This AJ doesn't have any reflective elements, but we don't think it needs them anyway. Personally, we wouldn't recommend this pair to play outdoors, and indoor courts should always have great visibility! Test results Air  XXXIX No Tongue padding We loved the design of this averagely padded tongue. Its 9.0 mm of padding are spread throughout the structure focusing on the parts where the laces might hurt the instep the most, like the top. Test results Air  XXXIX 9.0 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type A semi-gusseted tongue made our feet feel even more warmly hugged by this Air Jordan. Test results Air  XXXIX Both sides (semi) Price We can understand where the 200 dollars this pair costs come from: its premium ZoomX foam. Its energy return and bounce are just absolutely otherworldly, and it's the type of foam that we see in top elite running shoes like the Alphafly 3 or the Vaporfly 3 . And trust us, those are hella expensive as well! Test results Air  XXXIX $200 Average $135 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes $70 Price $210 Heel tab Following what feels like a Jordan tradition at this point (yes, Luka 1 , you're the exception to the rule), the AJ XXXIX doesn't feature a heel tab in the back.

The Ja 2 is a low-profile shoe that offers wonderful traction and court feel for the fastest guards. Its lightweight yet springy build accompanied our most explosive moves during the wear tests, as its Air Zoom unit pushed us back up every time we landed after a rebound or a jump shot. Nevertheless, even though we're pretty happy with this Nike pair's performance, its materials feel as cheap as they ones from the previous iteration .

You're looking for something lightweight and responsive to create openings and move the ball around. You're done with break-in periods and painful rubbing. Who should NOT buy Even though we do find this hooper slightly better than its previous version, Nike still hasn't fixed the cheap-feeling materials that we saw in the Ja 1 . We do believe there's been a general upgrade, but it's just not the same as wearing other Nike models . Although the Freak 6 or the Immortality 4 are not the most premium pairs out there, these two signature shoes from Giannis are quite solid and still really affordable. Your browser does not support the video tag. Despite its wonderful traction, the Ja 2 is not ready for the harshness of outdoor courts. We believe its wonderful pattern would lose its grippy nature as soon as it wears down. But don't worry, we have reviewed multiple shoes that you can use to happily play streetball . Cushioning Shock absorption New The Ja 2 is not the shoe to turn to if you are looking for maximum cushioning. Light and speedy, we found that this Nike shoe has just enough impact protection to keep the feet and joints adequately protected without detracting from the court feel. Nimble guards like Ja Morant himself will appreciate its low-cushion setup with a moderate shock absorption of 94 SA in the heel and 80 SA in the forefoot. Heel Forefoot Test results Ja 2 94 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New Now it's time to check if that small Zoom Air unit does anything to boost the shoe's springiness. With an energy return of 59.8%, we found that its forefoot is indeed livelier than the heel (only 49.8%). However, it is not much bouncier than the average basketball shoe, so we wouldn't call it springy or propulsive. It is decently responsive for a light and shifty player. Heel Forefoot Test results Ja 2 59.8% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack Just by having a look at the Ja 2, anyone can guess it's definitely not a tall hooper. Our caliper returned 26.1 mm, which is fairly lower than average. Test results Ja 2 26.1 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack Contrary to what we expected, this Nike pair has a taller forefoot stack. At 22.2 mm, its height is increased by an Air Zoom unit at the ball of the foot that provided some bounce. Test results Ja 2 22.2 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop With such a similar score on both the rear and forefoot stacks according to our caliper, the Ja 2's drop couldn't be any higher than this. Don't worry, because even at 3.9 mm, this shoe doesn't feel completely flat. In fact, we really enjoyed the court feel it offered during our playtests. Test results Ja 2 3.9 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. Our durometer returned 33.5 HA when we checked its midsole softness. Being lower and harder than average, you shouldn't expect the Ja 2 to feel like a couple of clouds underfoot. We don't think this pair focuses that much on impact protection but, honestly, that's not what we wanted from it either! Its design is clearly not oriented in that direction. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Ja 2 33.5 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Nike Ja 2 fits slightly small (108 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit After thoroughly brainstorming and investigating multiple ideas here in RunRepeat, we decided to create a special gel in order to measure the dimensions of the shoes we buy. We pour this gel into every pair and then let it freeze so our calipers can provide us with precise measurements. Your browser does not support the video tag. In this case, the Ja 2 scored 90.7 mm. This result is lower than average, but just by looking at it, you most likely guessed it wasn't going to be a roomy shoe. Test results Ja 2 90.7 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width The good news is that this Nike hooper doesn't taper like crazy. Our caliper returned 70.5 mm when we measured its toebox width at the big toe, which is higher than average. We can't say our standard-width feet had plenty of space to move around, but we can't complain either! Test results Ja 2 70.5 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height We were pretty surprised when our caliper returned 27.4 mm. To be honest, the toebox height of the Ja 2 actually surpassed our expectations. But the best part is that this shoe features a stretchy mesh on the toe area that let us push it all the way up. Even though this hooper provides more of a snug fit overall, we could lift our toes easily and never felt like the upper material was pushing them down. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Ja 2 27.4 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New The Nike Ja 2 bit the floor so easily, and we never felt like we needed more grip when dribbling or going for explosive cuts (like the backdoor ones). No wonder the shoe returned a solid coefficient of friction (0.77) in our grip test on a professional basketball flooring. Test results Ja 2 0.77 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New The Ja 2 features a highly textured outsole with various geometrical shapes and lines. This treading faces all directions to accommodate hard stops from every angle. Flexibility / Stiffness New Judging by the way it felt on foot, we honestly thought that bending this Nike shoe would require less force than our flexing tester showed. At 22.1N, the Ja 2 needs a little more force than the average basketball shoe. Even though we know every case and every foot is different, we need to say that, personally, we didn't have to deal with any kind of break-in period. To us, the Ja 2 was comfortable from the very first time we put it on, and even though some warm-up is always needed, it wasn't a painful experience at all. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Ja 2 22.1N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight This Nike hooper felt pretty speedy on foot. In fact, we could run up and down the court easily, and dribbling workouts were just a piece of cake. Our scale confirmed it in the lab when it returned 11.85 oz/336g, which means this shoe is way lighter than average. Personally, we believe this is just one more fact that screams why the Ja 2 is built for players with a quick footwork. Test results Ja 2 11.9 oz (336g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability Even if we played for hours, we never felt like the Ja 2 would let our feet drown in their own sweat. To know more about this, we took this shoe to our lab and performed our light test. Your browser does not support the video tag. The LED could only shine through the toebox, which is pretty much what we expected. To see if there were any other areas that would let the air come in and out, we turned on our smoke machine. Your browser does not support the video tag. Thanks to our comparative breathability video, we can see how the Ja 2 has improved its ventilation skills in contrast with the Ja 1 . As you can see, the later lets the smoke out through its tongue, yet the newest model focuses on offering a well-ventilated toebox. Despite having a multilayered design, this Nike pair let the air flow pretty easily. Consequently, we've decided to give it a solid 4/5 on breathability, surpassing the score of its previous iteration on this very same test. Test results Ja 2 4 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test During our wear tests, we never felt like we'd lose our balance whilst wearing this Nike pair. Even though it doesn't feature crazy high lateral walls or rubberized stability components, our feet felt safe and sound! Your browser does not support the video tag. Torsional rigidity Just like with pretty much every hooper, twisting the Ja 2 was challenging to say the least. Even though it was not so much of a brick in comparison to other shoes, our fingers struggled just enough for us to give it a 4/5 on our torsional rigidity test. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Ja 2 4 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness The heel follows the same logic, and if it wasn't for the sides, which complied a little bit more, we would have given this Nike pair the highest score on our heel counter stiffness test. But ah well, it got a 4/5, which is not bad at all! Following our experience wearing it, you can forget about any kind of heel slippage too. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Ja 2 4 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot The Ja 2 doesn't have the widest midsole. At only 111.2 mm, our caliper confirmed its width at the forefoot isn't really close to the average. Even though our standard-sized feet didn't feel they needed a wider landing base, we usually appreciate them when we jump constantly. That being said, we also think the design of this pair is more suited for quick players, and the fewer materials, the faster a shoe usually is! Test results Ja 2 111.2 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel Our caliper returned 87.4 mm when we measured the midsole width at the heel, which is also lower than average. Even so, we didn't feel the Ja 2 lacked stability during our wear tests. Test results Ja 2 87.4 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability Our Dremel test looked really, really bad. As you can see in the video, the tool ate up the mesh as if it hadn't had breakfast, yet this shoe features so many layers that somehow... it withstood the damage! After such a brave performance, we decided to give it a 3/5 on durability. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Ja 2 3 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability The thickly padded heel suffered the same torture. At 5K RPM and with 2N of force, the tool couldn't really do much to destroy the back of the Ja 2. As this area also fought back pretty well, we decided to give it another 3/5 on durability. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Ja 2 3 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness When we measured this shoe's outsole hardness, our durometer returned 79.5 HC. This score is pretty much average, just slightly lower, so the rubber used at the bottom of the Ja 2 might focus a little bit more on grip than on durability. Test results Ja 2 79.5 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability Our Dremel came back for a 3rd round, but this time at 10K RPM and with the same 2N of force. After drilling the rubber for a solid 18 seconds, the shoe ended up with a 1.1 mm deep dent, which is just the average. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Ja 2 1.1 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness When we cut the shoe in half and had full unobstructed access to its outsole, we grabbed our caliper one more time. It marked 3.5 mm, which is slightly lower than average. If we take this and the previous outsole durability score into account, personally we wouldn't recommend the Ja 2 to play streetball. Test results Ja 2 3.5 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness The Ja 2 features a very standard insole that, according to our caliper, is 4.2 mm thick. It's pretty much what we expected, as the brand wouldn't go for a thicker piece in a shoe where you're supposed to feel the court under your feet. Test results Ja 2 4.2 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole This shoe features a removable insole, so don't worry if you want to change the Ja 2's insole and use your own orthotic. Test results Ja 2 Yes Reflective elements The reflective elements this Nike pair features at the back look incredibly cool. Even though we believe you should not wear it to play outdoors (and indoor gyms should always have proper lighting), it's such a charming detail that we had to mention it yes or yes. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Ja 2 Yes Tongue padding We loved how this hooper's tongue is padded right where it should be. At the top, its plushness goes up to 9.2 mm, which is pretty much average. That's exactly where we press our laces to tie the shoe, so this pillow protected us from any kind of lace bite. The rest of the tongue is quite slim, pretty much just like the whole upper. In order to keep its weight low, the Ja 2 doesn't have extra padding where it doesn't need it. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Ja 2 9.2 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type We can't say the Ja 2 offers the best support ever, but its upper and lace system managed to make it warp around our feet comfortably. The fact that it features a fully gusseted tongue helps a lot, and it's a huge change in comparison to the Ja 1 (for the better, clearly). Test results Ja 2 Both sides (full) Price The Ja 2 is out at the same price the Ja 1 was, which is something we're really happy about. To be fair, we didn't really see an improvement regarding the cheap-feeling of its materials, but... we can't complain. Seriously, this shoe gave us what it had to give us, and it showed a pretty good performance. It's definitely a solid hooper so, in our opinion, it's fairly priced. Test results Ja 2 $120 Average $135 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes $70 Price $210 Heel tab This Nike pair was a little bit hard to put on because of its structure, yet the brand decided that was our problem... and didn't add any kind of heel tab at the back. But by adding it, the designers would've had to remove the \"12 AM\" detail, which is a reference to Morant's midnight training sessions. And we really, really like it!

Its solid upper offered us wonderful containment and durability, so it was ready for our most aggressive plays. Its firm underfoot feel and cushioning also contributed to this, as we never lost our balance. But the best part is that its amazing traction and low profile kept us close to court and in control no matter what. Even though all this sounds like the perfect match for quick guards, thanks to our scale we found out this Adidas hooper is pretty heavy, which might not be faster players' cup of tea.

You want something super supportive and with an unobstructed ground feel to go for precise and controlled moves. You're looking for a very durable hooper at a reasonable price. Who should NOT buy The solid and supportive structure of the Anthony Edwards 1 Low is not the easiest on foot, as it comes with a substantial break-in period. Its upper materials don't really give in... at all. Just in case that wasn't enough, it also features firm cushioning, an underfoot X plate, and a thick shank. So yeah, this Adidas pair doesn't feel like a cloud! If that's what you're looking for, the Nike G.T. Cut Academy might be a great alternative. It features a soft and bouncy midsole, and its supportive materials don't really require a bad break-in period. In our experience, it was just some warm-up! Your browser does not support the video tag. This pair also feels quite heavy. Which is a shame, actually, as it has the perfect design for quicker players. If you're looking for a nimble hooper, here you have the basketball shoes we've reviewed that have made it into the lightweight category. Cushioning Shock absorption New With a thicker Boost unit in the heel, the AE 1 showed much better shock absorption (105 SA) in the rearfoot than it did in the forefoot (70 SA). This setup offers more impact protection in the heel to accommodate hard landings while keeping the forefoot grounded for better court feel and control. However, bigger players may prefer shoes with more substantial cushioning from heel to toe. Heel Forefoot Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 105 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New Measuring the AE 1 Low's energy return, we found that its Lightstrike and Boost tandem offers a pretty energetic ride from the heel (61.0%) to the toes (54.9%). While this Adidas shoe could be more springy in the forefoot, it walks a fine line between propulsiveness and stability. Heel Forefoot Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 54.9% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack At 29.1 mm, this Adidas heel stack is just average. During our wear tests, it didn't feel like a high shoe that would separate us from the court. In fact, it was quite the opposite! Its lower sole offered us some extra ground feel for quicker and more aggressive moves. Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 29.1 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack The toe area follows the same idea. Our caliper returned 19.5 mm when we measured it, which is slightly lower than average. We found this set-up pretty convenient for quick guards who like to dribble their way into the paint, as we felt in control of our moves and pretty stable overall. Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 19.5 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop As both the heel and the forefoot stack heights are quite low to the ground, the Anthony Edwards 1 Low doesn't have a high drop. Once we had done our math, we realized it's just 7.5 mm, which is actually quite low. This means the rearfoot won't feel super high, but rather on a closer level to the toes. Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 9.6 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. This Adidas features two types of cushioning: Lightstrike as the carrier foam and Boost as the primary cushioning foam in the heel and forefoot. Measuring the latter, our durometer returned 31.0 HA, which is firmer than average. Our experience during the wear tests totally matches this result, as we can't say this hooper feels soft underfoot. Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 31.0 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Secondary foam softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. As we were saying, the Anthony Edwards 1 Low feels quite firm. Following our experience playing basketball whilst wearing it, we realized it focused more on ground feel and stability. Consequently, we didn't really feel much bounce or plushness from it. Your browser does not support the video tag. The carrier Lightstrike midsole scored 36 HA on our durometer, which once again is harder than average. Just don't expect a couple of clouds underfoot! Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 36.0 HA Average 27.8 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Size and fit Size Adidas Anthony Edwards 1 Low fits true to size (120 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit We felt pressure on our toes but the overall fit was OK. To put numbers on our experience, we created a gel mold of the shoe's interiors. Your browser does not support the video tag. Measuring it at its widest returned 99.3 mm. This result is way wider than average, which is great news, as we had a problem with the very tip of the shoe; yet the rest felt great! Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 99.3 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width During our wear tests, we felt the Anthony Edwards 1 Low pressed our toes... quite a lot, to be honest. When we measured the width of the toebox at the big toe, our caliper returned 67.6 mm. This score is lower than average, which means there's no space for your toes to happily wiggle around. We believe our standard-width feet wouldn't have had any problems with this if it wasn't for the tight rubberized overlayer right on the toes. In our experience, this area needs a good break-in, as it was pretty constrictive during our first uses. Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 67.6 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height According to our caliper and experience, this Adidas pair sits pretty low on the toes. Its 23.1 mm plus the rubberized toeguard we've just mentioned make it pretty tight, so it might not be the best choice for hoopers who like that extra space on the toe area. Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 23.1 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New The Anthony Edwards 1 Low is the shoe to get if you want to stop on a dime every single time. Even though it is a debut shoe, it exhibited elite-level traction in our lab tests! Measuring the shoe's stopping power on a specialized basketball flooring, our machine recorded a high friction score of 0.85. This is nearly as high as the 0.88 we got in the $210 LeBron 21 ! This Adidas shoe required very little wiping and provided a consistent grip even on dusty floors. Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 0.85 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New This Adidas pair features a traditional herringbone pattern with a spily structure throughout the whole outsole. As you can see, there are also many flex grooves that show a red (in this colorway) piece in the shape of an X. So... remember we were saying this pair felt really stiff on foot? Well, that crimson cross is just another reason why! This X plate definitely needs some break-in too, which is the price to pay for all the underfoot support it provides. Flexibility / Stiffness New Despite its massive sidewals and a full-length shank, the AE 1 Low turned out to be only moderately stiff. Our flexibility testing machine recorded that it takes a force of 20.9N to bend this Adidas shoe to a 30-degree angle which is just as much as it takes an average basketball shoe. That way we got a decent forefoot pliability (especially after a short break-in period) without losing the snappiness and stability of a stiffer hoop shoe. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 20.9N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight When we played ball with this pair we felt safe and sound, yet not very fast. Even though its low profile and solid design is great for quick players, we do believe there's a breaking point here: the weight. When we took the Anthony Edwards 1 Low to our lab, our scale marked 15.77 oz/447g, which is significantly higher than average. Thanks to our experience, we can also say this shoe feels kind of clunky on foot. So, if you're looking for something quick, this ain't it! Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 15.8 oz (447g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability We could see the light shine easily through this shoe's upper, as it's designed using a porous mesh covered by a rubberized material with hive-like ventilation holes. Your browser does not support the video tag. Even though this promised great breathability, we don't jump into conclusions until we perform our smoke test. To our surprise, and as you can see in the video below, the tongue was the one that let the air out! Your browser does not support the video tag. In comparison to the Nike G.T. Hustle 3 (on the right) and its perfect score, this Adidas pair couldn't really do much. Even though it felt pretty hot after playing for a while, it wasn't so bad. That's why we decided to give it a 3/5 on breathability. This design promised great airflow, which is the main reason why it's so important to perform more than one lab test regarding breathability. Playtests are also just as crucial, as we get a lot of information from personal experience alone! Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 3 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test The lateral stability of the Anthony Edwards 1 Low is pretty neat. Despite being the low-top version, our feet felt supported and the containment was great overall. Its solid materials offered us some extra confidence to give our all on the court, as we never felt we were losing control even if we jumped for a rebound in traffic or were hit mid-air on a fast break layup. Your browser does not support the video tag. Torsional rigidity The wonderful lateral stability of this Adidas pair also comes thanks to its solid upper. It's made using rubberized materials that offer wonderful containment and torsional rigidity. As you can see in the video below, there was no way on Earth for us to be able to twist this shoe, so we gave it a perfect 5/5 on our torsional rigidity test. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness The heel also felt like a wall. Even though we tried really hard to push it with our thumbs, it just wouldn't give in! This is because it features an external and internal counter that offered great support to our rearfoot, so we didn't really experience any kind of heel slippage. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 5 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot The 115.3 mm base of this Adidas hooper at the forefoot offered safe and stable landings even after unsteady jumpshots. Even though it's an average score, it felt just right to us, so we played confidently in every single game. Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 115.3 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The heel felt more roomy, but with the stiffness and double counter, we never felt like it was too much. Our caliper returned 94.1 mm, which means there was plenty of space for our feet to land comfortably after every jump. Even though our advice is to always try and land with your forefoot, sometimes the heel just touches the court first! Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 94.1 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability Luckily for the Adidas Anthony Edwards 1 Low, our Dremel had to face a protective layer before it could get to the black (and flimsier) upper material. At 5K RPM and with 2N of force, it couldn't get past this armor, but it obliterated it all. Mixing both these facts, we decided to give this hooper a 4/5 on our toebox durability test. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 4 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability Even though it didn't have any protective layers, the heel left us open-mouthed after our Dremel test. We didn't change any parameters to perform it, so the material also had to face the tool at 5K RPM and with 2N of force. After such a great performance, we decided to give it a solid 4/5 on our heel padding durability test. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 4 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness To measure the outsole hardness, we put the shoe upside-down and pressed our durometer against it. It returned 81.6 HC, which is an average score. Consequently, this Adidas should offer a healthy mix of durability and traction. Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 81.6 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability Confirming our previous hypothesis, this hooper showed great durability on our Dremel test. This time at 10K RPM but with the same 2N of force, the tool only managed to leave a 0.8 mm dent on the Anthony Edwards 1 Low's outsole. Excellent durability result! On the downside, we can't wholeheartedly recommend the AE 1 Low for streetball because its tread lines are way too thin for abrasive outdoor courts. The shoe is going to lose its gripping capacity pretty quickly. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 0.8 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness After verifying how durable this shoe's rubber outsole is, we understood why the brand didn't go for a thicker piece. At 4.3 mm, our caliper marked the Anthony Edwards 1 Low's outsole is just average. Even though it was clearly not enough, we believe it's a good move to reduce the overall weight of this hooper. Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 4.3 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness This Adidas pair features a thin and standard insole. We don't have much to say about it, it's just 4.2 mm thick and pretty simple. Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 4.2 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole As we've mentioned before, this Adidas has a simple and standard insole. But the good thing is that it's removable, so in case you need some extra support, you can always change it. Just bear in mind that this hooper's fit is not the most spacious and it also has a tight structure! It just won't give it. Consequently, if you opt for a super plush orthotic, it might feel too cramped. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low Yes Reflective elements Even though we're not talking about a premium-priced hooper, it does feature a premium detail that usually comes with more expensive shoes. Just look at the video below to guess what we're talking about. What a nice and shiny touch! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low Yes Tongue padding At only 5.5 mm, this tank of a shoe has a pretty thin tongue. Once again, we believe this is a good decision from the brand in order to reduce the overall weight; and even though it wasn't enough to make this pair fit into the lightweight category, we didn't have to deal with any lace bite or uncomfortable rubbing. So... not bad, Adidas! Test results Anthony Edwards 1 Low 5.5 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Price After thoroughly analyzing this shoe, we can say the Anthony Edwards 1 Low comes full of positive features for a quite low cost. It's pretty close to budget models, but just in terms of price, as it definitely does not feel like one. Just because of its incredibly durable structure, we do believe this Adidas pair is absolutely worth a try.

Cut Academy Nike G.T. Cut Academy review Dimitrije Curcic On on Aug 13, 2024 - updated  Jul 2, 2025 | Reviewed using methodology 1.8 Our verdict The G.T. Cut Academy is the takedown model of the Nike G.T. Cut 3 , but its affordable price tag comes full of advantages! This Nike pair features a tough upper and extra eyelets at the top that offer a customized fit. We enjoyed the containment and lockdown feel of this shoe in every step, as our cuts were propelled by its Zoom Air unit on the forefoot. Even though we could fly up and down the court thanks to its lightweight structure, this shoe's materials are not the most durable out there. If you're looking for a pair of hoopers that stay by your side for a longer time, investing in a more expensive model might be worth it!

Cut Academy stay forever on your wish list if you're looking for: A Nike shoe that offers customized lockdown and containment. An affordable pair from a well-known brand that features its technologies (Zoom Air). A padded and light hooper ready for quick cuts and harsh rebounds. Who should NOT buy Forget about this shoe if you're looking for a hoop partner that will play with you for a long time. If that's your case, we believe you should check the durable Precision 7 , which is also an affordable Nike basketball shoe ! Your browser does not support the video tag. The G.T. Cut Academy is definitely not a breathable model! Trust us, if you hoop in the summer with these kicks... your feet are gonna need a break from all the sweating. If you want your toes to enjoy a nice breeze, leave it to the UA Curry 10 or Curry 11 ! Just take into account that newer signature pairs tend to be more expensive. Cushioning Shock absorption New Considering the shoe's price point, we were very pleasantly surprised by the G.T. Academy's impact protection. Its dual-density Renew foam and forefoot Zoom Air unit returned the same shock absorption measurements as the more advanced basketball shoes! With 104 SA in the heel and 91 SA in the forefoot, it turned out to be even better cushioned than the average! Heel Forefoot Test results G.T. Cut Academy 104 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New Checking the shoe's energy return, we found that the Renew foam lacks the rebound of Nike's more expensive cushioning compounds. But it doesn't feel completely dead either, showing a decent measurement of 49.8% in the heel. And with a Zoom Air unit in its forefoot, the G.T. Cut Academy turned out to be more responsive under the toes at 57.6%. But overall, the ride of this Nike shoe feels controlled and tempered rather than springy, which is an optimal setup for a beginner player. Heel Forefoot Test results G.T. Cut Academy 57.6% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack This Nike pair's heel stack is slightly higher than average at 31.6 mm. Its extra foam and shock absorption made us feel safe enough to blindly and aggressively go for rebounds, which is something we really appreciated as it goes hand in hand with our playstyle! Test results G.T. Cut Academy 31.6 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack The forefoot stack of the G.T. Cut Academy also turned out to be slightly higher than average at 23.5 mm. The extra millimeters of foam and the presence of a Zoom Air unit detracted from the court feel but kept the balls of our feet much safer. Test results G.T. Cut Academy 23.5 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop With a standard drop of 8.1 mm, we didn't have to get used to the G.T. Cut Academy or readapt our stride. It felt natural and comfortable on foot, which made us enjoy our playtests even more! Test results G.T. Cut Academy 8.1 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. This shoe features a double-density Renew foam midsole that felt incredibly comfortable during our games. First, we measured the red foam (in this colorway), which is closer to the foot; and our durometer returned 19.6 HA. This score is way lower than average, which means it felt really soft underfoot. This elevated our comfort levels, and we loved every bit of it. Then, we analyzed the white foam (also in this colorway), which is closer to the ground. Our durometer now showed a harder result of 26.5 HA. This adds some durability and stability to the ride. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results G.T. Cut Academy 19.6 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Nike G.T. Cut Academy fits slightly small (143 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit If you normally get a standard D medium width in your athletic shoes, then the Nike G.T. Cut Academy should fit just right! Your browser does not support the video tag. We felt no dead space or tightness ourselves and the shoe's gel mold confirmed our on-foot experience. Applying our caliper to the widest part of the mold resulted in a standard reading of 92.7 mm. New test (recommended) Old test Test results G.T. Cut Academy 92.7 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width The mold also revealed the shoe's rounded and non-restricting toebox shape. Measuring its width near the big toe returned an above-average reading of 72.5 mm - lots of wiggle room to accommodate all five toes beautifully. New test (recommended) Old test Test results G.T. Cut Academy 72.5 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height This Nike shoe also provides ample vertical space to prevent excessive pressure on top of the toes. Its toebox height of 24.9 mm lowers the risk of developing black toenails or any other painful toe conditions. Test results G.T. Cut Academy 24.9 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New We are more than happy with the traction offered by this budget-friendly offering from Nike. Its friction score clocked in at a moderate 0.67 but made us feel decently surefooted on the hardwood. Test results G.T. Cut Academy 0.67 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New The G.T. Cut Academy features a spiky herringbone tread pattern which appears to be identical to that of the G.T. Cut 3 , except that it is made of hard rubber and not of translucent one. That explains a slightly lower friction score of the Academy compared to the Cut 3. Flexibility / Stiffness New Even though this shoe feels comfortable and fast on foot, its transitions are definitely not the smoothest. At 23.8N, our flex testing machine proved that the G.T. Academy requires more force to bend in the metatarsal area. It gave in little by little after the break-in period, yeah, but even after some games we can't say it rolled easily alongside our feet! New test (recommended) Old test Test results G.T. Cut Academy 23.8N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight During our wear tests, this pair felt pretty nimble on foot. When we ran up and down the court, we felt quite fast, and even though we need to partially thank the midsole for this, its low weight also played an important role here. So when we took this Nike to our lab and put it on the scale, we were really happy with the result. At 12.05 oz/342.0g, it's definitely on the lighter side of the basketball shoes. Your browser does not support the video tag. This translated into quick footwork and extra comfort. Overall, playing in the G.T. Cut Academy was really nice. And it didn't make our legs too tired too soon! Test results G.T. Cut Academy 12.1 oz (342g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability Let us get straight to the point: this shoe felt hot. Your browser does not support the video tag. That's what our feet said after our wear tests, and we could clearly see it when we took it to our lab. During our breathability test with the smoke machine, the G.T. Cut Academy didn't want the air to get away from it. To understand the difference better, just compare its performance with the Curry 10 , which most likely was a train in its past life! Your browser does not support the video tag. We checked the upper using our light just in case there were some hidden ventilation holes, but... nothing at all. Our microscope agreed after having a look at the knitted pattern of the upper. As it's tightly woven, there's no way our feet would breathe comfortably in that. Consequently, we've given this Nike a 2/5 on our breathability test. Test results G.T. Cut Academy 2 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test If we take into account our vast experience in shoes, we can't say the G.T. Cut Academy is the most stable model we've ever reviewed. But we can say its containment and lockdown feel are both fantastic, and our wear tests proved it! Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see in the video, our ankles didn't get to play much from side to side. The upper of this Nike stopped any excessive movements, keeping our joints safe. Torsional rigidity The G.T. Cut Academy has a well-structured upper, and our torsional rigidity test verified it! Your browser does not support the video tag. Our thumbs struggled a lot, yet they couldn't get this model to bend at their will! That's why we've given it a solid 5/5 on our torsional rigidity test. Test results G.T. Cut Academy 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness Once we put our hands on the heel counter, we knew it had followed the same path as the rest of this Nike's structure. Your browser does not support the video tag. Not even the laterals were that forgiving this time, and the Achilles area... pretty much felt like a wall! Even though this meant the shoe would require some break-in, it also translated into great support and containment. Our heel stayed right where it should, which made us feel safe and confident during our games. Honestly, that's pretty much all we need to hoop! Test results G.T. Cut Academy 5 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot The midsole width in the forefoot of this pair is average, at 115.1 mm according to our caliper. Even though this is nothing crazy, we found this shoe pretty stable when we landed. Why? Well, because of the protuberance this shoe's sole has on the outer side! It helped us regain balance when we landed after a rough hit mid-air in the rebound. Test results G.T. Cut Academy 115.1 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel At 88.2 mm, the G.T. Cut Academy's midsole width in the heel is slightly narrower than average. Despite what our caliper says, we didn't feel unstable underfoot. So don't worry! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results G.T. Cut Academy 88.2 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability After its less-than-graceful performance on our breathability test, the G.T. Cut Academy was up for a harder battle. It was the moment to redeem itself and show us that the lack of ventilation of its toebox was because of its toughness! Your browser does not support the video tag. Well, the tool attacked the knit and... messed it up. But it wasn't so bad, though. Also, if we look at the inner side of the shoe, right in the toebox, there's a wax top layer that protects the material. But we always put out Dremel in the very same spot. Why? Because in that way, we can compare the results of every shoe that gets the VIP pass to our lab! Anyway, even though we've decided to give the Nike G.T. Cut Academy a 3/5 on our toebox durability test, which is not the highest grade, it doesn't sound that bad if we compare it to the results of the Nike Precision 6 : a sad 1/5! Test results G.T. Cut Academy 3 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability Anyone would believe that the toebox and the heel of a shoe should get the same score on our durability tests, yet it doesn't always match. And the G.T. Cut Academy is here to show you an example! Your browser does not support the video tag. Even though our Dremel tried its best, the heel of this Nike pair held on for dear life! The tool could barely scratch it, so we gave it a well-deserved 5/5 on our heel padding durability test. We could barely see it! This result becomes all the more impressive if we compare it with the poor Reebok Answer DMX and its messy 1/5 on this same test. Look! Test results G.T. Cut Academy 5 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness When our durometer returned 90.0 HC, we couldn't help but nod. Now that's impressive! This means the outsole of the G.T. Cut Academy should be more durable than average. Even so, the score is not so high for it to lose traction. But hey, no spoilers! We'll talk about this soon enough, but in its corresponding section. Test results G.T. Cut Academy 90.0 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability Our Dremel had one last chance to fight this Nike pair, and it took it very seriously! Your browser does not support the video tag. We grabbed a tread gauge to measure the dent left by the tool. At 1.3 mm, it's slightly deeper than average, which means this shoe doesn't have the most durable outsole out there. Still, it's not a bad result! The pattern is textured enough to protect the main base of the outsole, so don't worry, the G.T. Cut Academy won't leave your side in a couple of days. Test results G.T. Cut Academy 1.3 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness With a thickness of 4.2 mm, this shoe's outsole is just average. Nevertheless, as you might remember, our durometer returned a high result. Consequently, we don't believe this Nike would need a thicker outsole, as the material is already pretty hard. Going for a bigger rubber piece would just add some undesirable extra weight to the G.T. Cut Academy! Test results G.T. Cut Academy 4.2 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness At 4.4 mm, our caliper confirmed this shoe's insole is average and simple. There's nothing special here, so let's move on! Test results G.T. Cut Academy 4.4 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole Removable insoles are our thing, and the G.T. Cut Academy complied! As we stated before, this pair has a pretty standard insole. Nothing special, really. But don't you worry about a thing: you can just change it and use your own orthotics! Test results G.T. Cut Academy Yes Reflective elements The G.T. Cut Academy doesn't feature any reflective elements according to our lab results. Test results G.T. Cut Academy No Tongue padding A puffy tongue is all we needed as the final touch of this Nike pair's containment. And, as you can see, we got it! The best part is that the G.T. Cut Academy's tongue accumulates its padding right at the top, a key area, as that's where we'll be tying our laces. Overall, this shoe's interiors are pretty padded (just look at that heel collar!) and the upper material is not stretchy at all. This is a clear indicator of its snug fit, so don't expect it to give in a lot! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results G.T. Cut Academy 11.0 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type Despite its wonderful containment, what we definitely did not expect here was a gusseted tongue... yet we were surprised by one! We were pretty happy with it, as the shoe itself is already pretty lightweight, which means this supportive extra feature wouldn't hurt. What's more, it improves the containment given by the multiple eyelets we saw at the top. We really appreciated this feature, as it gives every player the freedom to tie their laces their own way! You can try multiple lacing techniques thanks to this, so don't hesitate to have a look at our guide just in case you need some inspiration. Test results G.T. Cut Academy Both sides (full) Heel tab This hooper doesn't have any kind of heel tab at the back. Its tight structure and unforgiving materials made putting our foot in slightly harder in comparison with other models, but it wasn't challenging or anything! Test results G.T.

This Nike model offers incredible support thanks to its exoskeleton structure and TPU details. Additionally, its sole flare, Air Strobel (heel), and Zoom Air (forefoot) make sure the feet land safely and softly. We loved the way its wavy outsole bit the floor, winning the traction fight even against dusty courts. Last but not least, the KD 17's lateral guard for toe-dragging moves allows it to have a mesh upper that increases airflow, making it wonderful to play when temperatures go up. Nevertheless, its stable and foot-locking design is not the best for wide-foot hoopers, as their toes will most likely be cramped!

Wonderful grip no matter the court, biting even dusty ones. A model with lateral stability details (TPU piece) in a flexible structure. A comfortable and breathable pal to play when it's hot (even streetball from time to time). Who should NOT buy When we put on this shoe during our wear tests, we felt its opening was pretty wide. This could've been solved with an extra eyelet, as we really don't recommend sizing up. Why? Well, because that would just make the opening wider, and the shoe itself might lose some of its wonderful support and stability. If you're looking for a hooper with great ankle support (and other stability features), we believe you should have a look at the most supportive pairs in our catalog . Your browser does not support the video tag. If you have really wide feet, the KD 17 won't do. Also, as we've explained before, sizing up is not recommendable in this shoe (at least in our opinion). Instead, we believe you should have a look at basketball shoes with a more spacious toebox like the New Balance TWO WXY V5 which is also available in wide options. Cushioning Shock absorption New We are amazed at how the KD 17 manages to provide above-average shock absorption while being a low-stack and grounded shoe! The answer lies in its use of a top-loaded Air Strobel and a bottom-loaded Zoom Air unit in the midsole. Both dampen the impact of hard landings, keeping the ride comfortable and the joints protected. Heel Forefoot Test results KD 17 108 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New Because of the Zoom Air placement, most of the KD 17's propulsion is concentrated in its forefoot. It showed some of the highest energy return measurements of 70.7% in this area, enhancing speed and explosiveness for take-offs, rebounds, and blocks. The shoe's lively forefoot balances out its otherwise grounded and muted profile. The KD 17 can feel dull in the heel with a below-average rebound of 53.7%. Heel Forefoot Test results KD 17 70.7% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack At 26.1 mm, the KD 17's heel stack is lower than average. The KD 17's low profile made us feel the court closer to our feet, which translated into more controlled and stable moves. When you're a quick player, this comes in really handy, as you're able to perform more complicated steps or dribbles more easily. Trust us, we verified it in our wear tests! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results KD 17 26.1 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack The forefoot stack follows the same path. At 20.5 mm, it's lower than average according to our caliper, yet includes one of Nike's coolest technologies. Test results KD 17 20.5 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop At 5.6 mm, this shoe's drop is among the average. This means there's not a big difference between the forefoot and heel heights. Test results KD 17 5.6 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. During our wear tests, we felt a big difference between the KD 17 and the 16. Both models are really comfortable, that's for sure, yet this new iteration felt way softer on foot. At 23.1 HA, it's even softer than average. And our feet noticed that! This shoe felt just right, and we really liked the mix between the plush midsole and the stability features (such as the midfoot shank). We never felt that this pair's base was too much, or way too plush for us to be stable. We can summarise our experience during the wear tests with just one sentence: the KD 17 gave us the best of both worlds! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results KD 17 23.1 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Nike KD 17 fits true to size (105 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit The KD 17 offers a less spacious, more one-to-one fit in a D medium width. Your browser does not support the video tag. Having created a gel mold of its interiors, we measured the widest part of the shoe at 91.1 mm. Only a tad narrower than average but still within the average range. New test (recommended) Old test Test results KD 17 91.1 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width The difference becomes apparent in the tip of the shoe's toebox where it gets notably narrower than the average basketball shoe. This taper angle reflected in a below-average width of 65.3 mm near the big toe. New test (recommended) Old test Test results KD 17 65.3 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height Gladly, the shoe's toebox height came out as expected at 23.5 mm. There is an ample amount of vertical space in this Nike shoe. Test results KD 17 23.5 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New The KD 17 offers a consistent and adaptable grip on hardwood which was reflected in a relatively high friction score of 0.74 in our grip test. This Nike shoe has great stopping power, supporting quick cuts and direction changes. Test results KD 17 0.74 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New The shoe features a wavy tread pattern with thick and sturdy treadlines that latch onto both indoor and outdoor courts very well. Flexibility / Stiffness New The KD 17 proved to be a bit more forgiving in the forefoot compared to its predecessor. Using a shoe flexing tester, we found that this Nike silhouette requires 20.3N to bend to a 30-degree angle which a standard amount of force for a hoop shoe. On foot, this score translated into quick and smooth toe-offs which acommodated our pump fakes beautifully. New test (recommended) Old test Test results KD 17 20.3N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight During our wear tests playing games with this shoe, we didn't feel it was dragging our feet down or anything like that. But we didn't feel fast either! Your browser does not support the video tag. We took it to the lab and put it on our scale. Honestly, we had quite high hopes, as the Nike KD was becoming lighter throughout the iterations. The 15's were 14.04 oz/398g, the 16's 13.9 oz/394.0g... and the 17's? 13.8 oz/390.0g! Yeah, these are small steps, but this Nike didn't stop taking them! Our scale returned 13.75 oz/389.8 g when we measured the left shoe. And a little bit less, 13.6 oz/385.5 g, when we checked the right shoe's weight! Honestly, we can't complain. Even if it's not by a lot, Nike keeps working hard to reduce the KD's overall weight; and we want to appreciate that! We definitely hope the brand keeps it up for future iterations. Test results KD 17 13.8 oz (390g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability The KD 17 is already showing us how much of an improvement it is right in our very first test. We grabbed our smoke machine and started to pump up some smoke into the shoe. Your browser does not support the video tag. Look at how incredibly well-ventilated the toebox is! It gets even more evident when we compare it with the Reebok Shaq Attaq (1/5), which struggled a lot to let our feet breathe. Your browser does not support the video tag. But when we put the KD 17 right in front of our light, we didn't see any ventilation holes. So, how come it actually let all that smoke out? We were pretty curious, so we grabbed our microscope and checked what was going on with the upper material. Look at that! Its woven mesh upper has multiple layers with many gaps. We can clearly see Nike focused on breathability after the warm KD 16 (scored a 1/5 in this test), but the brand also made sure durability was a priority. That's why our light didn't actually go through the upper despite its ventilation holes: there are just many layers! We decided to give the KD 17 a fantastic 4/5 on our breathability test. This isn't only a great score overall, but also a wonderful improvement regarding the previous iteration. And our feet loved it! Test results KD 17 4 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test There's a feature that basketball shoes don't play around with: stability! You know, you can prefer a more or less padded model; one that lets you feel the court underfoot or one that is extra cushioned to ensure impact protection; or one with a low-top or high-top structure. Those are all different possibilities that depend on your playstyle, position, and taste. Nevertheless, each and every basketball shoe needs to be stable. Your browser does not support the video tag. We can see it clearly in the video: the Nike 17 makes sure our heels don't overextend themselves! We loved the contentment its overall padded structure offered us. And hey, talking about structure, have a look at this: The KD 17's design is different from the one featured in older iterations. If you follow its midfoot plastic lines closely, you'll see all of them end in an eyelet. This worked as some kind of ribcage that embraced the shoe's upper, enveloping it in a nice hug that made our feet feel comfortable and safe during our playtests. Your browser does not support the video tag. To test it even more, we performed some lateral movement drills to warm up before our games. This is a basic move in the sport, especially in defense. As you might already know, to shine as a defender you need to be quick, sharp, confident, and good at reading your opponent. Even though the KD 17 can't give you all of that, it will definitely offer you the support needed to be daring whilst feeling safe. We really appreciated this, as it boosted our confidence when we played ball. When you feel your feet are right where they should be, there's nothing that can stop you! Torsional rigidity As we were saying, we really enjoyed this shoe's overall stability. That wonderful feeling of safety also came directly from the high torsional rigidity level of the KD 17. Your browser does not support the video tag. Our fingers were struggling a lot to bend this shoe! Despite our efforts, we could only make it move a little bit, so we rightfully gave the KD 17 a 4/5 on our torsional rigidity test. Apart from the ribcage-like structure that hugs the upper, there's another key piece in this puzzle. Your browser does not support the video tag. Can you see the TPU blue part right above the midsole with some letters and Swoosh on it? We've talked about it before, remember? Well, we believe that exact detail is the one preventing us from twisting the shoe more than necessary. Another great touch from Nike! Test results KD 17 4 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness The extra padded heel counter of this shoe also showed great stability. Not only during our wear tests, where it didn't let our heel slip or go for any weird moves, but also in the lab. When we tried to bend it and push it, it barely gave in! Your browser does not support the video tag. We really liked this, as it let us go all in when we played ball. You know, if you don't feel safe in your shoes, there's no way you'll go for risky plays! Test results KD 17 4 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot The Nike KD 17's midsole width in the forefoot is average at 114.9 mm. This gave us a solid base to land on, which we really appreciated! When we jumped from rebounds or went for layups, the fact that our feet could impact softly and safely on the ground (supported not only by this shoe's structure, but also by its technologies) made us want to keep playing. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results KD 17 114.9 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The KD 17's midsole width in the heel is not as narrow as the KD 16's, but it's still narrower than average. At 86.8 mm, this might mean that it might require a bit of a break-in for some people. Nevertheless, it fit our standard feet comfortably from the very first time we put it on. Test results KD 17 86.8 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability After the wonderful breathability levels this Nike showed, we didn't expect it to be crazy durable. We did have some faith in its toebox, though, as some of the threads used seemed to be on the thicker side. Your browser does not support the video tag. But... when we saw the white material flying around, we got ready for the worst. Yet when we removed the tool from the crime scene, the damage wasn't that bad! We could see the threads were a little bit of a mess up there, but it's not like the Dremel had completely destroyed the material or created a big hole. That's why we decided to give the KD 17 a 3/5 in durability. This is what we mean by \"the damage wasn't that bad\". On the left, the Nike KD 17 after our toebox durability test. On the right, the Nike Precision 6 after this same test. Look at all the broken layers of material, that's what a 1/5 looks like! Test results KD 17 3 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability Because of the results on the previous tests, we had our hopes up and expected the KD 17 to keep doing pretty well. Still, we knew that the heel area is the weak point of any shoe. Especially in basketball, with all the jumps, quick cuts, fakes, and post-play. Your browser does not support the video tag. Once again, we could see some threads flying around during our 4-second test. But we had learned our lesson, so we didn't jump to conclusions until we lifted the tool and checked the damages ourselves. We had to come closer to actually see it. The tool could barely fight the heel padding! This was great news for us, as the KD 17 showed as much resistance to abrasions as the previous iteration, getting a well-deserved 4/5 on our heel padding durability test. On the right, with the white pulverized material, we've got the Reebok Answer DMX . That's what a 1/5 on this test looks like! Test results KD 17 4 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness So far so good, KD 17. But we still have a lot of tests for you, don't worry! It was time for our outsole hardness test. This time, we grabbed our durometer instead of our Dremel, and turned the shoe upside down. Carefully sticking the tool against the rubber, we saw it returned 87.1 HC. This score is higher than average, which most likely means this shoe's outsole focuses a bit more on durability. In other words, the material should be slightly more long-lasting than average. Nevertheless, the score is not so high for the KD 17 to sacrifice its grip. Let us show you a quick video as proof... Your browser does not support the video tag. Okay, okay, fine. There's a specific section for that, so no spoilers! Test results KD 17 87.1 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability At 0.9 mm, our tread gauge indicated this shoe's outsole is slightly more resistant than average to abrasion. Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see, we grabbed our Dremel one last time and went all in for the KD 17's rubber. Despite the increase in speed (from 5K RPM to 10K RPM), the outsole put up a fight and bravely faced the tool. We were pretty happy with the results, as the Dremel didn't manage to completely obliterate the wavy texture of the outsole's pattern. Nevertheless, we believe it's important to tell you that, if those waves disappear, this Nike will most likely lose its traction. That's why we can't recommend it to play streetball exclusively! You can use it from time to time, sure, it should withstand a couple of games. But a constant or exclusive use outdoors might make you have to change shoes sooner than you'd like. Test results KD 17 0.9 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness To measure the outsole thickness properly, we need to cut the shoe in half. But this is not something that we do only on basketball models , we cut every pair into two! If you want to know more about the way we do things here, in RunRepeat, you should have a look at our testing methodology . At 4.0 mm, our caliper indicated the Nike KD 17's outsole is just as thick as average. Even though it's slightly harder than average, it's pretty much as durable. Taking all this into account, we believe the KD 16 is a much better option to play streetball. Test results KD 17 4.0 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness Our durometer returned 4.2 mm when we measured this shoe's insole thickness. This is pretty much average. We understand the brand's decision, as a more padded insole is not specifically necessary when this Nike is overall on the softer side. In other words, there's no need to add extra weight when we already have what we need from the shoe itself: comfort and stability! If you're not a fan of \"there's nothing special around\" insoles, just let us spill the tea for you: this one is removable! Test results KD 17 4.2 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole We had already hinted at this before, so yeah, the KD 17 has a removable insole! So, if you need to use your own orthotics or you want some extra cushioning or support underfoot, you'll have no problems here. Piece of cake! Test results KD 17 Yes Reflective elements Oh, wow! We were surprised to see the KD 17 lost the reflective elements in this newest iteration. It's true that we believe reflective elements are a nice and expensive touch in shoes, but it's not like we were gonna use them in this Nike specifically. You can use the KD 17 as if it were a pair of sneakers, that's for sure, but if you get it for its main purpose (which is playing some ball), then there will always be light around! Test results KD 17 No Tongue padding When our caliper returned 8.8 mm, we nodded in agreement. Even though it's not quite as much as the average, we really found it to be enough during our playtests. Let us explain why! First, less padding means less weight, and we love that! Second, this model features an overall padded structure and a stable design, apart from a gusseted tongue; in other words, the brand didn't need to go overboard with the tongue's padding. Third, the padding is strategically divided, saving weight and focusing on the key areas to avoid lace bite or any kind of uncomfortable rubbing. Test results KD 17 8.8 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type The fully gusseted tongue of the KD 17 added some extra support and foot containment, which are two features that we really, really love. At the same time, we felt relieved when we saw this supportive structure. If you want to know why, just have a look at this shoe's collar. It's pretty big, isn't it? Despite being well-structured and fairly padded, we felt safer knowing the tongue was also doing its best to keep our feet right where they should be. We believe this could also be solved with an extra top eyelet. But ah well, maybe for the KD 18! Test results KD 17 Both sides (full) Heel tab No heel tab around! But it's not like we missed it anyway, to be honest. We loved the fact that the brand added the player's name right at the back. It's a super stylish detail that substituted the heel tab.

This Nike model offers incredible support thanks to its exoskeleton structure and TPU details. Additionally, its sole flare, Air Strobel (heel), and Zoom Air (forefoot) make sure the feet land safely and softly. We loved the way its wavy outsole bit the floor, winning the traction fight even against dusty courts. Last but not least, the KD 17's lateral guard for toe-dragging moves allows it to have a mesh upper that increases airflow, making it wonderful to play when temperatures go up. Nevertheless, its stable and foot-locking design is not the best for wide-foot hoopers, as their toes will most likely be cramped!"

Its top-tier performance and playability made us want to play with it over and over again, just like its incredibly lightweight and fast structure. Even though we barely felt it in our feet, it features super durable materials and a wonderful cushioning set up (the most advanced Cushlon foam + an Air Zoom unit). It also provides loads of court feel, yet this Nike's outsole will have a hard time withstanding outdoor courts if you're planning to wear it as much as we did.

You're a small forward who relies on solid traction for explosive cuts. You want something comfortable off the bat with a marvelous cushioning setup. You're done with having to choose between either durability or breathability. Kobesque aesthetics are your thing. Who should NOT buy We don't really have a lot of negative things to say about Ionescu's latest hooper! In fact, if it wasn't for its average outsole durability, we'd even recommend it to play streetball. If that's exactly what you had in mind, then we believe you should have a look at this section of our catalog , as we have reviewed fairly durable hoopers that can withstand the abrasion of outdoor courts. Your browser does not support the video tag. After all our testing (inside and outside our lab), we believe the Sabrina 2 is more suitable for quick guards and small forwards. These players tend to be smaller overall and, many times, also quicker. If you're a big guy, a center or a power forward, we believe these basketball shoes should suit your playstyle and build better. Cushioning Shock absorption New The Sabrina 2's impact protection is quite limited, but it is to be expected from a low-profile shoe that's specifically designed for shifty guards. We recorded some of the lowest shock absorption measurements in this Nike shoe - 92 SA in the heel and as little as 62 SA in the forefoot. Heel Forefoot Test results Sabrina 2 92 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New With a snappy Zoom unit under the toes, the Sabrina 2 showed an impressive energy return of 68.5% in the forefoot! It is some of the most propulsive hoop shoes we've tested, making take-offs and high-speed directional bursts feel charged. The shoe's heel showed a slightly lower reading of 63% but it is still above the average, offering a nice rebound. Heel Forefoot Test results Sabrina 2 68.5% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack As expected from a shoe that focuses on letting you feel the court under your feet, the Sabrina 2 has a 24.6 mm heel stack, which is lower than average. But we never felt like this hooper lacked cushioning, it was more of a \"we understand what Nike is trying to do\" feel. Test results Sabrina 2 24.6 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack But at 17.3 mm, the stack height of this shoe gets even lower at the forefoot! In fact, it managed to break our \"lowest toe area\" record again, surpassing its previous iteration and coming second to only the Zion 3 (which scored only 15.5 mm on our caliper). Test results Sabrina 2 17.3 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop After doing our math, we discovered that this Nike's drop is average, at 7.3 mm. This is neither good nor bad, as the drop is all about personal preferences! If you want to know more about this, here is our guide on the topic. Test results Sabrina 2 7.3 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. This hooper features two types of foam: a firmer carrier Cushlon foam, and the plush Cushlon 3.0 (which is the brand's newest cushioning). When we pressed our durometer against the latter, it returned 22.1 HA, which confirms the soft feel we enjoyed during our wear tests. Despite being on the plush side, the Zoom technology and the shank we mentioned before didn't let the foam bottom out. In fact, we felt this shoe's comfort and underfoot support in every game we played. Still, considering its design, you shouldn't expect anything crazy cushioned. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Sabrina 2 22.1 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Nike Sabrina 2 fits true to size (116 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit Even though just by looking at this hooper you'll most likely think it's not a very spacious shoe, during our wear tests we enjoyed a fantastic fit. Honestly, the Sabrina 2 melted with our feet and made us completely forget about it! To put this feeling into numbers, we took the shoe to our lab and poured a gel into the shoe. Your browser does not support the video tag. Once it froze and we could put our caliper around it, the tool returned 92.3 mm when we measured it at its widest, which is pretty much average. Test results Sabrina 2 92.3 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width When we moved it all the way up to the big toe, our caliper returned 70.4 mm. This is good news to us and our standard-sized feet, because even though we didn't have a lot of space to move our toes around, it means that this Nike hooper doesn't taper like crazy. Which is unusual for the shoes of this brand! Test results Sabrina 2 70.4 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height We could put our toes up easily thanks to the extra space the Sabrina 2 has on its toebox. The vertical volume on this area goes all the way up to 24.9 mm according to our caliper, surpassing the average. We didn't feel any pressure or discomfort during our wear tests, which is something greatly appreciated by any hooper. Test results Sabrina 2 24.9 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New Having zero complaints about the Sabrina 2's gripping capacity, we were surprised to record just a moderate friction score of 0.71. It's not as glue-like as the Nike LeBron 22 (0.95) but it inspires plenty of confidence on the court. Test results Sabrina 2 0.71 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New This Nike shoe relies on a mix of zig-zaggy, wavy, and linear tread lines to provide an adaptable grip for hard stops, pivots, and acceleration. Also, the Swoosh in the center is partially hollowed out, making the shoe feel lighter and more agile. Flexibility / Stiffness New As expected from such a nimble and quick shoe, it doesn't take much force to bend it to a 30-degree angle. Actually, our shoe flexing tester showed as little as 13.4N, which is one of the lowest readings we've recorded in a basketball shoe! This is just another proof of why this hooper is ideal for faster players who like to dribble past their defenders or go for explosive layups. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Sabrina 2 13.4N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight This is one of the aspects we love the most about the Sabrina 2. Even before taking it to our lab, its whole design told us it was a fast shoe. We verified it during our wear tests, as running up and down the court felt effortless. To put this experience into numbers, we put this Nike on the scale, and it marked 11.96 oz/339g. As all of us already expected, this score is lower than average. And it isn't just the weight, but also the whole fit and pliability of this hooper what makes it feel that fast. Test results Sabrina 2 12.0 oz (339g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability We still can remember how the Sabrina 1 felt like a couple of toasters for our feet, but when we played ball wearing this newest iteration... our feet could magically breathe! Well, maybe not so magically, as right after our light test we knew the brand had taken matters into its own hands. Your browser does not support the video tag. Can you see the LED shining through the material when we move our fingers around? Well, our smoke machine tells a very similar story, as the air could get in and out of this Nike pair easily. Unlike the LeBron 22 , the Sabrina 2 offered us wonderful breathability, so we decided to give it a 4/5 on this test. As you can see in our microscope close-up, the material of this shoe's toebox looks tight and solid. But... appearances are deceptive. That's why it's so important to conduct multiple tests before giving a final score regarding ventilation! Test results Sabrina 2 4 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Even though this shoe is built to be fast, we're really happy to say Nike didn't forget about its stability. As you can see in the video below, the Sabrina 2 stays low to the ground and keeps your feet in place. We can't say it's built like an armor, just like some of the LeBron hoopers (which, by the way, share a similar Kobesque aesthetic up until the last iteration), but it does its job properly. Your browser does not support the video tag. Torsional rigidity We didn't have to deal with a break-in period with the Sabrina 2. This shoe hugged our feet comfortably from the very first minute we put it on, which is something we greatly appreciated. When we took it to our lab and tried to twist it, it didn't make our fingers get massive cramps like many other hoopers. As it was fairly easy to do so, we decided to give it a 3/5 on our torsional rigidity test. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Sabrina 2 3 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness Even though it features a more pliable structure overall, this Nike's heel counter decided not to follow the vibe. The rearfoot containment and support is just wonderful, yet the heel counter was not as rigid as to give us blisters or uncomfortable rubbing. Consequently, we decided to give it a solid 4/5 on our stiffness test. Oh, and also, no heel slippage whatsoever! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Sabrina 2 4 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot The stability of the Sabrina 2 doesn't only come from its shank, which offers great support, but also from its wider midsole at the forefoot. Our caliper returned 115.7 mm, which is thanks to this shoe's sole flare. Even though we believe this hooper is better for quick guards, it still has enough support and stability for those willing to fight in the paint from time to time. Test results Sabrina 2 115.7 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The heel follows pretty much the same logic, and our caliper reading is just average. At 90.1 mm, our standard-sized feet had enough space to land comfortably and, at the same time, enjoy the fantastic containment of the Sabrina 2. Test results Sabrina 2 90.1 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability We were left in awe by the resilience of this shoe. Even though the Dremel went all in at 5K RPM and with 2N of force, the Sabrina 2 fought back like a champ and ended up with a mere scratch. It owned a well-deserved 5/5 on our durability test, which is an incredible score for such a breathable pair! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Sabrina 2 5 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability With another 5/5 on durability, the heel padding of the Sabrina 2 fought back the Dremel fearlessly. As you can see in the video below, the damage didn't jeopardize this shoe's integrity at all, proving that one doesn't need extra rigid materials to be sturdy! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Sabrina 2 5 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness When we pressed our durometer against this shoe's outsole, it returned 71.9 HC. This score is way lower than average, which usually means the rubber used for the Sabrina 2's outsole focuses more on grip than on durability. Test results Sabrina 2 71.9 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability Our hypothesis regarding traction and durability came true when the Dremel devoured 1.1 mm of this shoe's outsole. At 10K RPM and with 2N of force, it's never easy to fight this tool back when it attacks for a whole 18 seconds. Even though the depth of the dent is average, we believe the Sabrina 2 is not the best option to play streetball. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Sabrina 2 1.1 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness Nike is giving us one more reason why this pair is suited for indoor courts. Our caliper marked 3.8 mm when we measured its outsole thickness, which is nothing spectacular. Therefore, it's not like the Sabrina 2 features a crazy chunky piece of rubber to make its outsole last longer. Test results Sabrina 2 3.8 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness The minimalist feel of the Sabrina 2 comes with a 3.5 mm thick insole. There's not much for us to say about it, it's just thinner than average and it doesn't offer much support or comfort. Test results Sabrina 2 3.5 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole We're happy to say the Sabrina 2 features a removable insole that you can always change if you need or want to. Test results Sabrina 2 Yes Reflective elements You're the one that's gonna shine wearing this hooper, not the Sabrina 2! Test results Sabrina 2 No Tongue padding We were protected from any lace bite thanks to the 8.1 mm of padding this Nike basketball shoe has on its tongue. In fact, after looking at how padded the overall structure of the Sabrina 2 is, we were pretty surprised (positively, of course) about its wonderful score on breathability. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Sabrina 2 8.1 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type The wonderful lock-in feel this hooper offers comes, partly, from its fully gusseted tongue. It's designed to hug your feet comfortably and not let go, and that's exactly what we felt during our wear tests! Test results Sabrina 2 Both sides (full) Price You are getting a real lot for just $130. This Nike hooper doesn't need a thousand technologies (even though it does feature a couple of them) to be a top performer. If you love basketball as much as we do, you'll probably know the Sabrina 1 became a fan's favourite just pretty much after its release. And we sure expect its younger sibling to follow its same bouncy footsteps! Test results Sabrina 2 $130 Average $135 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes $70 Price $210 Heel tab The fully gusseted tongue plus its stiff and extra thick heel counter make putting on the Sabrina 2 a whole minigame. Nike, you could have added a finger loop to give us a hand! But anyway, don't worry, as long as you untie properly, you'll be fine.

Because of this observation, we absolutely cannot recommend this shoe for wide-footers. We believe they are better off with shoes like the PUMA MB.02, which have more forgiving toeboxes. Your browser does not support the video tag. Don't get us wrong, the whole cushioning system worked just fine during our games. We are confident to say that this part of the shoe is safe. But 'safe' might not be enough for players who want a more pronounced court feel. They may go for guard-oriented picks such as the DON Issue 4 from Adidas . Cushioning Shock absorption New The PUMA All Pro Nitro caters to various types of players, offering a standard amount of shock absorption for a basketball shoe. Our machine recorded regular readings of 103 SA in the heel and 82 SA in the forefoot. It's a reliable and consistent cushioning that maintains comfort for all four quarters. Heel Forefoot Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 103 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New The All Pro Nitro's versatility also shows up in its moderate energy return. With no crazy rebound technologies in its midsole, the shoe returned below-average readings in both the heel (46.2%) and the forefoot (46.7%). It is not a propulsive shoe by any means, but it keeps the foot nice and grounded. Heel Forefoot Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 46.7% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack When it comes to cushioning, the All Pro Nitro from PUMA kept it moderate and average. The moment we put it on, we already felt that it was roughly the same height as the typical basketball shoe. True enough, we learned that the heel is just as thick as the average at 30.5 mm. Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 30.5 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack The forefoot stack height is also just around the average. Our caliper readings pegged it at 22.6 mm. Now, are we complaining? Definitely not! The average thickness of this shoe's cushioning system afforded us a balance of court feel and impact protection. Many in our team appreciated this setup, especially those whose playing roles and styles in the game switch widely. Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 22.6 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop There was not a lot to rave or complain about the drop of the All Pro Nitro. It was just around the average at 7.9 mm. Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 7.9 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. We loved how soft the cushioning felt underfoot. When we assessed its softness using our HA durometer in the lab, we were pleased to see that it was indeed softer than average. It got a rating of 22.0 HA. During our test games, this softness helped us be free from pain and discomfort. We did not mind wearing it for long periods. Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 22.0 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Secondary foam softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. But given the shoe's dual-density cushioning setup, it also has a layer of firm foam below the plush one. The firm compound clocked in at 35.0 HA which is some of the firmest we've recorded in basketball shoes. It balances out the softness and makes this PUMA shoe feel more stable and grounded which is important for nimble playing styles. Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 35.0 HA Average 27.8 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Size and fit Size Puma All Pro Nitro fits true to size (41 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit We retrieved a mold of the All Pro Nitro's interiors using proprietary gel and it proved the shoe's medium fit. Your browser does not support the video tag. Measuring the mold of this PUMA shoe at its widest, our caliper returned a standard reading of 92.7 mm. If you have medium-sized feet, there should be no issues with the fit. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 92.7 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width The shoe's toebox doesn't get much narrower towards the toes either. Its slightly rounded shape is reflected in a standard width of 68.7 mm near the big toe. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 68.7 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height You can also expect an ample amount of vertical space as the toebox height of the All Pro Nitro comes in at the regular 23.7 mm. Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 23.7 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New The PUMA All Pro Nitro offers an amazingly surefooted experience on both clean and dusty courts! In fact, it is one of the grippiest hoop shoes in its price range. Its winning outsole configuration returned some of the highest friction scores (0.88) in our controlled forefoot traction test performed on a professional basketball court surface. Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 0.88 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New The All Pro Nitro features multi-directional razor-blade treads for added grip in the forefoot and a recessed pattern for a stabilizing suction cup effect in the heel. The large cutout in the midfoot adds agility to this PUMA shoe by making it lighter and more flexible. Flexibility / Stiffness New The PUMA All Pro Nitro is a highly flexible shoe indeed! It followed our movements one-to-one thanks to its very agreeable nature. That's why we found it to be particularly effective for quick steps and fake shots. Using a shoe flexing tester machine, we found that this PUMA hoop shoe required as little as 14.9N to bend to a 30-degree angle. This number is significantly lower than average. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 14.9N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight The PUMA All Pro Nitro is lighter than average at 13.2 ounces or 373 grams.  We never felt this shoe weighing us down during our test games. We were able to run fast and jump high as needed. Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 13.2 oz (373g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability Oh boy! The Puma All Pro Nitro was just so airy! We never felt damp, and we were so happy not to deal with wet socks after our games. Your browser does not support the video tag. As can be seen in the video above, the smoke that we pumped into the shoe escaped through the Puma All Pro Nitro's upper quite easily. The Reebok Shaq Attaq 's upper, which only garnered a breathability score of 1 out of 5, barely allowed smoke to pass through. Smoke could only escape through its tongue. Hence, the 4 out of 5 that the Puma All Pro Nitro got from us is pretty well-deserved. Your browser does not support the video tag. We also performed a light test on the upper. In the video above, the porousness of the upper is made clear. Light was able to pass through the many ventilation holes. We also put the upper under the microscope, and it gave us a good glimpse of the air vents that made the PUMA All Pro Nitro such a well-ventilated basketball shoe. Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 4 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test We never felt any issues with lateral stability. The side walls did their jobs well. The heel counter also did its job well (more on this below). Our feet were able to stay in place even when we were moving wildly to and from the basket. No serious complaints here. Torsional rigidity Sudden twists are not only disorienting, but they can also be so painful as well. Good thing this PUMA basketball shoe truly felt stable and firm no matter which direction we went. When we did some manual twists on it in the lab, we realized that we needed to break some sweat before we could make the shoe relent to our maneuvers. We were left with no other choice but to give it a perfect 5 for torsional rigidity. Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness Not only was the heel counter comfortable and durable, but it was notably stiff as well. In fact, it got a perfect 5 from us for its stiffness when we gave it a good squeeze in the lab. We never felt any unnecessary movements in the rearfoot because of how securely the heel counter was clasping our feet. Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 5 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot The forefoot part of the midsole is of average width. Our caliper measured it to be 114.2 mm wide. Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 114.2 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel We felt that the platform had a little more width at the heel part. When we measured it using our caliper, it was indeed wider (just a little, though) than average at 94.4 mm. The additional width helped us maintain our balance and stability, especially when we made more aggressive and shiftier movements. Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 94.4 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability The toebox displayed moderate durability. With proper care, we felt that this shoe can last as long as it's needed. Your browser does not support the video tag. After performing the Dremel test on it, we saw that there was still a sturdy second layer that could protect the foot even after the topmost skin had been worn off. It's truly worth the 3 out of 5 for toebox durability that it got from us. Yet, we have to take note here that wearers who are habitual toe-draggers might still need to look for another basketball shoe model. The Dame Certified from Adidas might be a better pick for them. Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 3 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability The heel padding surely looks smooth and soft, but we were so glad when we discovered in the lab that it's actually a very tough act! Your browser does not support the video tag. We pressed the Dremel into it, and the damage that it left is not even worth mentioning. We gave it a 4 out of 5 for heel padding durability. Because of our initial observation and subsequent lab results, we dare say that new wearers need not worry about this shoe falling apart after aggressive rubbing and ankle movements during intense games. Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 4 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness The outsole performed as expected during our test games. It was not too hard, and it was not too flimsy either. It delivered just the right amount of toughness for effective occasional outdoor usage. When assessed in the lab, our HC durometer gave it a hardness rating of 80.0, a figure that does not fall from the average. But if you are a frequent outdoor player, the PUMA All Pro Nitro might seem lacking. The outsole of the Adidas Trae Young 3 is harder and fairly resistant to abrasion. Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 80.0 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability Just like the hardness of the outsole, its durability is just around the average as well. Your browser does not support the video tag. We performed the Dremel test on it, and our high-pressure drilling left as much damage as it would in an average shoe: a dent that is 1.0 mm deep. Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 1.0 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness Our caliper showed that the outsole of the All Pro Nitro is slightly thicker than average at 4.6 mm. So even if its outsole is only as durable as the typical basketball shoe, we expect this shoe to last longer simply because it has more material to burn. Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 4.6 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness Because the built-in foam was already soft and comfortable, we did not feel the need for a removable insole. But the PUMA All Pro Nitro came in with one, anyway, and it was as thick as the average at 4.4 mm. Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 4.4 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole The insole is removable, and it was quite easy to get rid of when we needed to use inserts or just wanted a more forgiving fit. Test results Puma All Pro Nitro Yes Tongue padding The tongue is moderately padded, and it is 10.0 mm thick as per the caliper readings in the lab. This much material in the tongue helped fasten the fit. The padding also contributed a lot to the comfort that we enjoyed, and it dulled down the impact of when other players stepped on our feet. Test results Puma All Pro Nitro 10.0 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type The tongue has a full-gusseted design. Upon wearing this PUMA hoop shoe, we immediately noticed that this design helped in securing its clasp around the foot. Test results Puma All Pro Nitro Both sides (full) Heel tab The PUMA All Pro Nitro doesn't have a heel tab, so it has a streamlined look at the rearfoot.

The First Chapter of what we expect to be many more, we found this hooper to be the ideal partner for quick players who make last-minute decisions, dribbles, or cuts. Once the break-in period is over, its comfort levels go up like crazy. During our wear tests, we enjoyed the safety and snug feel of all its padding, as well as its coziness. Its traction was impressive, but what left us in awe were this shoe's incredible visuals. The Book 1 has a bball soul in an AF1 body, and we loved every bit of it! It doubles as a sneaker, but we wouldn't wear it in the summer: it's not breathable at all! Pros Incredibly comfortable once broken-in Wonderfully durable design Excellent outsole grip Smooth heel-to-toe transitions Nice lockdown feel Loads of padding OK for outdoors Ideal for quick players Very stylish: doubles as a sneaker Cons Not breathable at all Has to be broken-in Audience verdict 87 Good!

Is it an AF1? Well, yeah, it's actually both! We believe you should give Devin Booker's first signature shoes a chance if: You're a quick player that goes for fast dribbles and cuts, and loves shoes with a smooth transition. You want a pair with a good lockdown feel, lots of padding and a solid structure. You want to go for some casual hoops outdoors from time to time. You're looking for a bball pal that can double as a sneaker because of how stylish it is. Who should not buy You can most likely tell once you look at these pretty pals: forget about playing basketball in the summer with them if you don't want your feet to become a couple of hot springs! Like, yeah, this shoe's style is pure fire, literally and figuratively. If you're looking for a more breathable pair, we suggest the Under Armour Curry 10 . Just don't play outdoors with it! Your browser does not support the video tag. These Nikes midsole is not the most bouncy out there. Additionally, it doesn't have an Air Zoom unit in the forefoot. After all, we believe this model was designed for quick guards and small forwards, like Booker himself. If you're a centre, a bigger player regarding size, or if you just fancy a more cushioned shoe, the Nike Cosmic Unity 2 might be worth checking out. If you don't mind going for something pricy, then the Nike G.T. Jump 2 is a solid choice. During our wear tests, it definitely felt like it was built to jump! Cushioning Shock absorption New The Book 1's low stack height can cause concerns about its cushioning. However, our shock absorption tests showed some reassuring results. With a large Zoom Air unit taking up its heel, the Book provides great impact protection with a category standard reading of 104 SA. It may not be enough for bigger players, but it is just right for light and quick athletes. The forefoot, on the other hand, doesn't offer much shock attenuation and leans more towards court feel with a below-average SA reading of 71. Heel Forefoot Test results Book 1 104 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New You can tell that the Book 1's Zoom Air unit is placed in the heel even without cutting the shoe in half! There is a tangible give that doesn't merely compress under pressure; it bounces back! We recorded a pretty high energy return of 64.6% which adds a bit of trampoline effect in the rearfoot. But on the downside, it contrasts with the shoe's muted and less responsive forefoot. With only 55% of rebound, it keeps the foot in better contact with the floor but doesn't give you any vertical jump advantages. Heel Forefoot Test results Book 1 55.0% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack At 26.9 mm, this shoe's heel stack is a bit lower than average but the Zoom Air unit ensures good cushioning in this area. Test results Book 1 26.9 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack The shoe's forefoot stack also turned out to be slightly lower than average at 19.9 mm. Offering more ground feel, this setup is best for guards or players who might need to change their mind at the very last moment, either because they've found an opening in the rival's strategy or because they're trying to deceive their defenders. Test results Book 1 19.9 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop Following the differences between the heel and forefoot heights, we found out this shoe has a drop of 7.0 mm. Test results Book 1 7.0 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. It might seem that the Book 1 has no midsole compression whatsoever, but it features a moderately soft Cushlon foam to dampen the impact in addition to a Zoom Air unit in the heel. Your browser does not support the video tag. Pressing our durometer against the foam returned a standard reading of 26.6 HA. It has a decent amount of give but is nowhere near the plushness of Nike's ZoomX foam. Test results Book 1 26.6 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Nike Book 1 fits slightly small (225 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit The Book 1's fit was a pleasant surprise for our average-width feet. The shoe offers a predictable D medium fit and an accommodating toebox shape. Your browser does not support the video tag. To back it up with lab measurements, we created a gel mold of the shoe's interiors. Once the replica was solid, we checked its widest part with a caliper and the tool returned an average reading of 92.2 mm - a true medium fit. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Book 1 92.2 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width Our caliper returned another standard reading of 69.9 mm near the big toe confirming the shoe's non-pointy toebox shape. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Book 1 69.9 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height A toebox height of 21.1 mm also proved to be adequate in this hoop shoe from Nike. Test results Book 1 21.1 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New Even though it's not some of the grippiest hoop shoes we've tested, we can confirm that the Book 1 is on the tacky side of the spectrum. Sliding the shoe's forefoot across a professional basketball surface, we recorded an above-average friction coefficient of 0.79. It is similar to the traction results we got in the Nike Ja 2 and the Jordan Luka 3 (both at 0.77) and translates into surefooted cuts and quick direction changes. And the best part is that the Book 1's traction gets even better once it warms up! Test results Book 1 0.79 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New Nike plays it safe with the tried-and-true herringbone pattern in the Book 1. Its full-length rubber outsole and thick treadlines are very reminiscent of a tennis shoe making this kick a viable option for outdoor courts too. Flexibility / Stiffness New We did say this shoe was comfortable, right? Well, mark out words, because at 17.1N, our flexibility testing machine confirmed how easily the shoe bends in the forefoot. This only added some more extra points to the fact that we would happily wear these hoopers as casual sneakers. So it was not just because of its incredible style, but also because of how comfortably they moved alongside our feet. When we were running up and down the court or when we were just walking around, once the break-in period was done, we didn't want to take this pair out! New test (recommended) Old test Test results Book 1 17.1N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight So it seems like and us, the RunRepeat lab geeks, were on the same page regarding this model's weight. At 13.6 oz / 386.0g, the Book 1 is lighter than average, and that's exactly what our feet would tell you if they could talk! Your browser does not support the video tag. During our wear tests, we felt agile and ready to go for any move. We believe this shoe is designed for guards, just like Devin Booker himself, as it responded accordingly to quick footwork and fast dribbles in our games. We believe hoopers with a fast and explosive playstyle will feel at home with this pair, and we absolutely loved how it felt when we went for unexpected cuts, layups, or Euro steps. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Book 1 13.6 oz (386g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability When we opened this shoe's box and had a first look at it, our mind was already telling us it wouldn't be very breathable. But as the whole bunch of researchers we are, we decided to stop hypothesising and start testing. Your browser does not support the video tag. Our smoke test showed the Book 1's breathability (on the left) compared to the UA Curry Flow 10 's (on the right). We can see in the video how our Nike model manages to let the smoke out through the tongue, yet the UA one has a constant flow of air coming out of it. That's why the Book 1 couldn't get anything higher than a 1/5 in our breathability test, while the Curry model stands with a solid 5/5. Our microscope just verified it. With such solid and dense material, it's pretty much impossible for the air to happily go through it! This model was clearly not build with breathability in mind. Your browser does not support the video tag. As our final test, we put this shoe right in front of our light. We do this in order to find some pores or holes that will promote airflow. But we didn't even see a single one of those! So yeah, we can't recommend this pair to hoop in the summer, but we do believe it's a great pal for winter. Comfy, warm, and ready to play whenever you are! Test results Book 1 1 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test We were pretty excited to check the lateral stability of this lost twin of a sneaker. So we went to the court, put it on, and started wobbling our ankles. Your browser does not support the video tag. Look at that! There was no dancing for our heels, and we felt incredibly surefooted with these Nikes during our wear tests. The shoe's structure definitely contributed, that's for sure, but we want to highlight the incredible job its padding did regarding our lockdown feel. Your browser does not support the video tag. The support we felt was outstanding. Additionally, the plastic sidewall this model features adds extra points to its overall stability. And we LOVE IT! Torsional rigidity Of course this well-structured shoe decided it would not bend with our thumbs, we had such a hard time trying to make it move! Your browser does not support the video tag. We couldn't give it any less than a 5/5. The thing with shoes with high torsional rigidity is that they require a break-in period, as their structure doesn't naturally follow the foot's moves. These types of pals are designed to ensure safety and surefootedness, so they might be slightly harder to tame than other more flexible models. Your browser does not support the video tag. But let us tell you: once the break-in period is all over? COMFORT is coming. We were so surprised when the Book 1's made our feet feel so happy. We found it to be an incredibly comfortable shoe, and not only for the court! Its killer looks made us want to wear it to just walk around town. Hey, you always gotta be ready for some hoops, right? If you're nodding right now, then this is your shoe! Test results Book 1 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness As we were saying, once we could overcome these Nikes' break-in period, they became incredibly comfortable! But once we overcame it, that is... This model's rigid structure goes all the way to its heel. We tried to bend it, twist it, push it, pull it... we almost tried to take it out! But it didn't give it at all, just look at our video and you'll see. Your browser does not support the video tag. This unbending part made sure our ankles stayed right where they should. Its firm resolve to keep our feet secured translated into a welcoming 5/5 in our heel counter stiffness test. Despite what it might sound like, getting used to it was not that bad thanks to the amount of padding this area had. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Book 1 5 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot At 113.7 mm, this shoe's midsole width in the forefoot is just about average. Its platform is not especially wide, yet we didn't feel unstable at all. This is also because of the rigid structure and nature of the shoe, as it made sure our feet didn't dance around. Test results Book 1 113.7 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The brand gave this shoe's padded and stiff heel counter a midsole width that matched the same vibe. At 83.6 mm, this model's midsole in the heel is definitely snug, and way narrower than average. Even though there are times when a platform that is not wide enough makes the ride unstable, that's not the case of these Nikes. That's why it's so important to conduct wear tests, sometimes our feet and our lab results have different versions of the same story! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Book 1 83.6 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability Our feared Dremel is always ready to show us the reality behind the materials of our lab-tested shoes. Your browser does not support the video tag. At a speed of 5K RPM and with a force of 3.2N, our tool attacked Book 1's upper for 12 seconds. We always get excited when we see it rolling and rolling, and this time we expected a good result. Turns out we were right! Our Dremel ate up the very first layer, but it didn't manage to make a hole in the material or put the integrity of this shoe at risk. That's why this Nike earned a solid 4/5 in our toebox durability test. Great news! Here you can compare the results with a shoe that got a 1/5 in this same test, the Nike Precision 6 . As you can see in the picture on the right, the material of the toebox got completely obliterated by our tool. It managed to go through every single layer! Test results Book 1 4 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability We can happily tell you that the durability of the heel padding is even better! Your browser does not support the video tag. Our Dremel tried its best, but it didn't manage to do much. This shoe's heel padding acted like an armour and defended itself against our rolling tool. Check the results out! Impressive, right? Look at that! The heel padding seemed just fine, and even though it's such a vulnerable spot for shoes, the Book 1 handled it like a champ. Easy, peasy! All in all, this shoe got a wonderful 5/5 in our heel padding durability test. If you wanna see what the total opposite looks like: that is, earning a disappointed 1/5, you can ask the Reebok Answer DMX . On the right, you can see the white material all ruined. An outstanding victory for our Dremel! Test results Book 1 5 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness At 80.2 HC, our durometer told us this model's outsole is just as hard as average. This usually means the shoe offers a good mix of traction and durability, and we couldn't wait to test it! Even though we don't want to spoil the outsole durability results, regarding this aspect we can say that we enjoyed the Book 1's herringbone pattern during our wear tests. We'll talk more in detail about this topic in its corresponding section later on, stay tuned! Test results Book 1 80.2 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability We grabbed our Dremel one last time to check this shoe's outsole durability. Your browser does not support the video tag. After a 22-second long rolling attack at a higher speed (10K RPM) but with the same force as before (3.2N), our tool left a dent of 1.0 mm. Even though this is just over average, during our wear tests in highly abrasive courts we felt this outsole might not last as long as we'd want it to. The hardness and the grip of the outsole make this shoe okay for outdoor playing, but make sure it's a rubberised court. Asphalt ones will make you change hoopers before you want to! Test results Book 1 1.0 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness When our caliper returned 4.0 mm, which is an average score for an outsole of a basketball shoe, we nodded thinking that using this pair outdoors would definitely make it last way less. Still, we cannot say it's specifically designed for streetball, but it's decent for outdoor courts. Still, the material is not soft, so giving this model a thicker outsole would also make it heavier. We believe Nike went for the smartest choice here, as expected from such a popular brand! Test results Book 1 4.0 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness Its midsole is just a bit thicker than average, but nothing big. At 4.8 mm, your feet will definitely not notice anything different. It's a pretty standard piece, as the shank we found in the midsole already offers some arch support. If you need some more, you can always change the standard insole of this model (oops, spoiler detected!). Test results Book 1 4.8 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole We found this shoe's insole to be pretty comfortable! Still, if you need your own orthotics or if you're simply looking for something different, don't worry: you can always change it. We love removable insoles! Test results Book 1 Yes Reflective elements The Nike Book 1 doesn't have any reflective elements. Lights: off! Test results Book 1 No Tongue padding At 11.7 mm, this shoe's tongue is padded! The overall locked-in feel we got from this was fantastic! Additionally, this meant no lace bite or hot spots. Yay! Test results Book 1 11.7 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type Its overall stiff and supportive structure doesn't have a gusseted tongue as the cherry on top. But it's not like we felt we needed it. In fact, with the overall stiff build of this model, we were actually grateful its opening was wide enough for our feet to get in without any difficulties! Also, the loop it has in the middle of the tongue, the top orange eyelet, and the strong lacing system united to give us the surefootedness we needed. We'll use this chance to talk about the soft layer the lacing system, the loop and the top of the tongue have. It felt wonderful when we touched it, and it adds an extra stylish and classy touch to the shoe that we found incredibly appealing. This sneaker-like hooper is just so aesthetically pleasing! Test results Book 1 None Heel tab The Book 1 has one of the coolest heel tabs we've seen lately. A finger loop that keeps looping! We loved the different colours, but the best detail (in our opinion, of course) is the fact that it has the year Devin Booker was born right at the top. But that's not all! As this is the first model the player launches, we can see it says \"Chapter One\" at the back. In our colorway, the mix of black and golden made it look incredibly epic. An elite player with an elite taste!

Its now solidified upper offers durability and breathability, apart from great support. The external heel counter adds up to this last part, as its TPU structure holds the Achilles, leaving room for the joint to move freely and make explosive and daring drills possible. We felt light and fast in this shoe, which we believe is ideal for guards with quick and nimble footwork. But our favorite part was the crazy traction of the outsole, as it grip literally on every surface. Nevertheless, its rubber is incredibly soft and weak to abrasion, so it's better not to use this UA pair outdoors; or you'll have to say goodbye to it sooner than expected!

A flexible yet bouncy forefoot for quick moves and smooth transitions. A shoe to feel comfortable and surefooted that doesn't restrict your movements. A pal that suits guards or any player with a quick and explosive playstyle. Who should NOT buy If you're a streetball lover, please forget about the Curry 11. Its outsole wouldn't last more than a couple of harsh games on an abrasive outdoor surface! If you need a durable pal to hoop outside, we think you should have a look at our streetball shoe catalog . Your browser does not support the video tag. If you're constantly changing positions and you're looking for a versatile signature shoe that includes some of the latest technologies (it features the brand's Air Strobel in the heel and Zoom Air in the forefoot), the Nike KD 17 might be exactly what you need! Cushioning Heel stack At 25.8 mm, this shoe's heel stack is slightly lower than average. But don't let this measurement fool you: we felt pretty comfortable in this shoe during our wear tests! Test results Curry 11 25.8 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack It was the same on the forefoot, as the stack was lower than average at 19.6 mm according to our caliper. This allowed us to feel the court better underfoot, which works in perfect harmony with the Curry 11's overall design. In other words, this translates into better move control and accuracy; after all, we do think this UA pair is made for quick players like Curry himself. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Curry 11 19.6 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop After measuring both heel and forefoot heights, we calculated the drop. At 6.2 mm, it's just average, so we didn't have to readapt our step or get used to something different underfoot. Now that we have a clear look at the shoe's sole structure, we're gonna take the chance to explain a couple of things: It features a full-bed of dual-density UA Flow cushioning. We found it really comfortable, and appreciated its shock-absorbing properties. But that's not it, it also offers some bounce! An internal and almost full-length shank (the black lines) that's divided in the forefoot. This detail offers stability and pop, yet the best part is that, as it's divided in the forefoot, it allows smoother moves and easy transitions. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Curry 11 6.2 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. We measured the softness of the dual-density UA Flow cushioning at 28 HA and 29 HA according to our durometer. Here we're measuring the yellow-ish foam, which is between the insole and the outsole. And here we're checking the hardness of the white foam, which is closer to the ground. Both results are slightly higher than average, that's just true. Nevertheless, we think it's important to highlight that neither did this have a negative effect on the overall comfort, nor did it make the shoe more \"brick-like\". We really enjoyed our games with the Curry 11, as we felt comfortable, surefooted, and well-supported. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Curry 11 27.9 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Under Armour Curry 11 fits true to size (23 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit When we measured the toebox width at the widest part, our caliper returned 103.1 mm. This gave our standard-sized feet enough room to rest comfortably, as the structure was not too tight or compressive. This shoe follows methodology 1.8. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Curry 11 103.1 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width We can happily say the same about the toebox width at the big toe! At 79.9 mm, the more round structure of the tip of the Curry 11 gave our toes plenty of space to spread as they needed in every landing. This made us feel more confident, elevating our game to new heights! We also really liked the sole flare, as it offered protection for toe-dragging and stability for landings! Look at that white wall on the side of the toebox, that's exactly what we're talking about. Your browser does not support the video tag. This shoe follows methodology 1.8.

Test results Curry 11 79.9 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Flexibility / Stiffness After our wear tests, we already knew the Curry 11 wouldn't get a high score on our flex test. After all, we felt it bent comfortably with our feet, following our moves smoothly. Your browser does not support the video tag. At 27.7N, it's definitely way more pliable than average. After seeing this result in the lab, we came to appreciate even more the divided shank this shoe features, as it gave us not only stability, but also easier transitions.

Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Curry 11 27.7N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight During our wear tests, we felt pretty fast in this shoe. If you know a bit about Stephen Curry, you'll be familiar with his quick playstyle and nimble footwork. And that's exactly what this shoe gave us! When we took it to our lab, our scale returned 12.0 oz/340g, which is a weight way lower than average. We believe that part of this is thanks to the mixed materials of its upper, which give the Curry 11 durability, breathability, and comfort right where it needs them. Your browser does not support the video tag. As it's a solid 13% lighter than average, our feet felt really fast. We could go up and down the court easily, and whenever we played either point guard or shooting guard, we found it ideal. It followed our moves nicely and it never slowed us down!

Test results Curry 11 12.0 oz (340g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability The incredible breathability levels that the Curry 10 showed us are absolutely unforgettable. With that being said, of course we had high expectations when we grabbed our smoke machine and got down to business. Like, who wouldn't?! Your browser does not support the video tag. And the Curry 11 didn't disappoint! Even though most of the smoke came through the shoe's sides (and not through the toebox itself), the results were still wonderful. Especially if we compare it with the Nike Book 1 , which is basically a toaster. All in all, we gave this UA pair a solid 4/5 in breathability, which is much higher than average! Your browser does not support the video tag. Remember what we were saying about the sides? Well, look at our light test! That means airflow, trust us! When we grabbed our microscope, we checked the knit of the Curry 11 to see if the brand was using the same material. Its IntelliKnit is here once again, yet not around the whole upper like in the previous version. We believe this is a smart decision from UA to increase the 11's durability. The tightly woven knit wouldn't let the air go through. Nevertheless, we found it pretty comfortable during our wear tests. Test results Curry 11 4 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test We're gonna go straight to the point: the foot containment levels of this shoe were great! Your browser does not support the video tag. You can see it clearly in the video. Our wobbly ankles are stopped by tough walls that don't let them overextend themselves! We really liked this, as it made us feel safe when we were playing ball during our wear tests. We've said it before: we think this model is great for quick guards, and its structure seems to completely agree! The new design of the upper brings some give-in and breathability, but overall it focuses on improving the containment and support of the Curry 10. Torsional rigidity Following what we were saying just a couple of paragraphs before, the mixed materials of this shoe give it a little bit of everything. That's exactly why we believe it didn't get a score as high as the other basketball models on our torsional rigidity test: the Curry 11 earned a 3/5. Your browser does not support the video tag. You can see in the video that it does give in a little bit, but if you need further evidence, let us show you one more clip. Your browser does not support the video tag. This is the Adidas D.O.N. Issue 5. Look at our fingers struggling to bend it even half an inch. That's what a 5/5 in torsional rigidity looks like! Even though a higher torsional rigidity means a shoe is well-structured, as well as more support, it also comes with a break-in period. In other words, the materials need to give in with time so you can enjoy their full comfort levels. Your browser does not support the video tag. The Curry 11 might not have the toughest structure out there, yet it still felt stable to us. Additionally, it was quite comfortable right out of the box! This is something that we really appreciate, as it meant we could just put it on and go play some ball straight away. Test results Curry 11 3 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness Yep, we're just gonna say: we ADORE the Curry 11's heel structure! Let's go with the heel counter stiffness test first, and then we'll dive into our love. Your browser does not support the video tag. The sides gave in a little bit, but the back of the heel didn't move that much! Why? Well, because it features a 3D-molded TPU heel counter that we're obsessed with. It offers a lot of support and stability, but it also improves the overall fit! But wait, don't jump into the next section just yet, we're not done here! Look at how well the sides surround the ankle; this means the joint has full and unrestricted mobility. Then, we've got a big wall right in the Achilles, adding support and surefootness. We think UA nailed it with this design! Test results Curry 11 3 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot At 118.3 mm, the Curry 11's midsole width in the forefoot is wider than average. A wider base always equals a more stable ride, which is something we absolutely love! We appreciated it a lot when we went for daring layups that ended up in unstable landings. After all, this shoe gave us the confidence and speed to try them out, even though you pretty much always end up hitting a defender on the way! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Curry 11 118.3 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The Curry 11's heel followed the same stability path as its forefoot. At 96.0 mm, our caliper indicated it's a wonderful 6% wider than average. Which, trust us, is a lot! Test results Curry 11 96.0 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability To verify if our hypothesis regarding the Curry 11's breathability-durability ratio was correct, we grabbed our feared Dremel and went straight for the top layer. Your browser does not support the video tag. Even though we could see the materials fly away, we kept our hopes up... and we were right! The tool managed to do quite some damage, yet it didn't break through the whole golden layer. Additionally, this didn't have a negative effect on the shoe's integrity, so we gave it a well-deserved 4/5 on our toebox durability test. Here, on the right, we have our Curry 11 and its colored upper. On the left, our poor Nike Precision 6 , which ended up getting destroyed by the Dremel. We couldn't give it a grade higher than 1/5! Test results Curry 11 4 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability Our Dremel still had some work to do, so we moved it all the way down to the heel. At 5K RPM and with 3.2N of force, we attacked the heel padding for 4 seconds. Your browser does not support the video tag. Honestly, the results were pretty good. Just look at the difference between the Reebok Answer DMX and the Curry 11 on this same test. Wow! The Reebok model scored a sad 1/5, and just by looking at that picture, you'll most likely understand why. On the other hand, we decided to give the Curry 11 a 3/5, which is a pretty good score! It almost made it to the 4/5 on our scale, yet there's some part of the damage where the tool managed to go slightly deeper. Test results Curry 11 3 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness The Curry 11 follows its role model regarding the outsole hardness. Our durometer scored 58.4 HC, which is a crazy low result compared to the average! In other words, the Curry 11's outsole is a whole 29% softer than average. Here's where we started trembling, is the Dremel going to completely obliterate this shoe's rubber? Even if it actually happens, we're pretty positive this UA pair will offer crazy good traction. To make it simple: A harder outsole equals more durability, and a softer outsole translates into a better grip. Test results Curry 11 58.4 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability The results of our outsole hardness test were already hinting at something, but we're here to provide actual facts and move past simple hypotheses. That's why we grabbed our Dremel and started the Curry 11's last durability test. Your browser does not support the video tag. At 10K RPM and with 3.2N of force, the tool attacked this shoe's outsole for 22 seconds. And the results... were pretty scary. Just look at that! Our tread gauge returned 4.2 mm, which means the dent is an incredible 74% deeper than average. Among the basketball shoes that got the VIP pass to enter our lab, the Curry 11 is the one that ended up with the deepest dent. In other words... it's got the weakest outsole! So we really, REALLY advise you against using this UA pair to play outdoors. Streetball might be a little bit too much for the Curry 11, and the abrasion of the sport would definitely make it suffer way too much. Test results Curry 11 4.2 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness In order to compensate for the awful results of our outsole durability test, we believe the brand went for a thicker-than-average rubber piece. Our caliper had to open wide to reach the 8.5 mm of the outsole thickness. Even though this definitely means that there's more material to wear down, we still can't say this pair is made for the streets! Test results Curry 11 8.5 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness Under Armour kept things easy and simple in the insole. At 3.7 mm, our caliper indicated it was thinner than average. Once again, this didn't translate into any kind of discomfort, and it most likely helped to reduce the overall weight of the shoe. So... win-win situation, right UA? Test results Curry 11 3.7 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole Yes! A removable insole! As we mentioned in its corresponding section, the Curry 11's insole is thin and simple. The official website mentions it's molded for long-lasting and step-in comfort. Which we agree with, of course, but still... we found it pretty average. Anyway! What we want to say is that, if you want to change it, you're free to do so! Test results Curry 11 Yes Reflective elements This is not a shoe to play streetball, so it doesn't really need any reflective elements. Gyms need to have the lights on to play bball! Test results Curry 11 No Tongue padding We were just talking about comfort, right? Well, there you have it: a super padded tongue! Our caliper returned 11.1 mm, which means the Curry 11's tongue is more padded than average. We loved the comfort this provided, as we could tie our laces as tight as we needed. The tongue was there to protect us from any kind of lace bite! Overall, this shoe has padded interiors that evolve into a comfortably snug fit. And our feet loved every bit of it. Your browser does not support the video tag. Thank you, Under Armour! Test results Curry 11 11.1 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type A fully gusseted tongue gives the overall comfortably snug fit of this shoe its final touch. We also didn't have any problems when putting the shoe on. As its structure is not super rigid, everything worked out with comfort as a priority! Anyways, some extra surefootness for us once again! We really liked the fact that the Curry 11 didn't need ultra-stiff materials to provide containment and lockdown. Test results Curry 11 Both sides (full) Heel tab Instead of a finger loop or a lace, this UA pair features an extended heel collar. Even though we didn't find the shoe hard to put on, this elongated structure definitely helps!

Its flexible and accommodating structure breaks with the past stiffer versions, providing smooth transitions and movements that require constant bending of the ball of the foot (like pretty much any kind of fake, for example). It features an IsoPlate and heavily padded interiors that add up to the tough upper material to offer wonderful foot lockdown and containment. Traction is yet another highlight of the Luka 3. It encouraged us to try more daring moves along with the shoe's supportive and stable structure.

Great foot containment, stability, and support features. A flexible and light pal to try quick moves. A shoe that mixes court feel and impact protection Who should NOT buy Honestly, we did expect a little bit more from a signature shoe of 130 dollars. We thought the brand would include some specific technologies in the midsole, but that wasn't the case. If that's what you were after, we believe the Nike KD 17 might be your cup of tea. Your browser does not support the video tag. After our wear tests playing streetball and our lab Dremel tests, we've also verified it's not the best to play outdoors. Its materials are not the most durable, and it doesn't feature strong toe-dragging protection at the forefoot. If you want to play outside, you should have a look at our streetball hoopers . Cushioning Shock absorption New Intended for shifty players who choose court feel over abundant cushioning, we weren't surprised that the Luka 3 returned below-average shock absorption scores. With 98 SA in the heel and 73 SA in the forefoot, it offers just enough impact protection to soften the blow of hard landings while keeping you quick on your feet. Heel Forefoot Test results Luka 3 98 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New The shoe's full-length Cushlon 3.0 foam showed some responsiveness but not enough to call it propulsive. We found its energy return to be on par with the average of basketball shoes at 55.4% in the heel and 59.5% in the forefoot. It is dynamic enough to encourage quick toe-offs and drives but not so explosive for vertical jumps. Heel Forefoot Test results Luka 3 59.5% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack In our playtests, we could experience how the Luka 3 let us feel the court under our feet. This translated into better movement control and accuracy, as there wasn't a massive chunk of foam making us lose precision or adding a disrupting bit of instability. When we took this shoe to our lab and measured its heel stack, our caliper returned 27.0 mm. The result caught us nodding, as a score below the average was totally in sync with what we felt during our wear tests. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Luka 3 27.0 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack We had a similar feeling with the forefoot. At 20.9 mm, our caliper indicated it's also lower than average, which paired just right with the court feel we got from the Luka 3. Just like we explained with the heel stack, this closer-to-the-ground structure let us perform specific moves more accurately; like wraparounds, for example. In order to get the most out of that move, we also need a higher-than-average traction level. Your browser does not support the video tag. But hey, no spoilers! We'll talk about grip on its own section. Test results Luka 3 20.9 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop After measuring the Luka 3's heel and forefoot heights, we can calculate its drop. At 6.1 mm, it felt standard on foot, so we didn't have to get used to it or anything like that. Test results Luka 3 6.1 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. When we cut shoes in half, we get full access to their midsole. This is really important, as the softness of such material can only be measured by making direct contact with it. Your browser does not support the video tag. So, even though sometimes it feels like we could just measure it from the outside, there might be a protective layer around (as it's pretty weak) that gives us an inaccurate result. In this case, at 20.5 HA, the Cushlon 3.0 is softer than average. After playing some ball with this shoe, it's exactly what we expected. We had a soft feel underfoot every single game, and even though the Cushlon 3.0 isn't the most durable foam out there (and it might bottom out earlier than you'd want), we still enjoyed our hoops to the max. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Luka 3 20.5 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Jordan Luka 3 fits half size small (80 votes). Consider sizing up Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit At 96.6 mm in the metatarsal area, the Luka 3's fit is significantly wider than the average and we love it! Your browser does not support the video tag. In our opinion, the extra space matches the shoe's stiffened-up build really well, as it helped our foot sit comfortably throughout the break-in period. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Luka 3 96.6 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width Big-toed hoopers, it's time for you to celebrate: the toebox width at the big toe of the Luka 3 stands proudly at 70.4 mm! Our standard-sized feet felt happy and comfy in this shoe, and our toes had plenty of space to spread freely in our landings. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Luka 3 70.4 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height This Jordan shoe doesn't skimp on vertical space either. With a typical toebox height of 22.4 mm, it shuld not aggravate any toenail concerns. Test results Luka 3 22.4 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New Testing the Luka 3's gripping capacity on a clean and polished court surface, we recorded a great friction score of 0.77. This translates into consistent traction for dynamic and explosive moves on the indoor court. Test results Luka 3 0.77 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New The Luka 3 mixes two types of rubber for the outsole. The hard rubber area features a radial herringbone pattern to provide the shoe's primary traction. Meanwhile, translucent rubber covers the central area. It helps to make the shoe a bit lighter and more pliable than it would be with a full-length hard rubber outsole. Flexibility / Stiffness New At 18.7N, the Luka 3 turned out to be slightly more forgiving than average. Our feet noticed this after a couple of games, when the shoe started to break in. This added flexibility helped us with fake moves a lot, as we could go back to our natural position after tricking our defender. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Luka 3 18.7N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight Talking about weight... it wasn't like this shoe felt like a brick for our feet, but we thought the brand would try to go back to the Luka 1's weight (12.8 oz/363g) after the heavy Luka 2 (14.50 oz/411g). Your browser does not support the video tag. Our scale indicated the Luka 3 stands at a solid 13.5 oz/384.0 g, which is an improvement if we compare it with the previous iteration, as it's now lighter than average. Luka 3's left shoe at 13.55 oz or 384g. Luka 3's right shoe at 381g. During our wear tests, we felt pretty good on the court, and we could easily go for quick moves. The lighter-than-average nature of this Jordan pair teamed up with its solid structure to give us a confidence boost that maxed up our performance. Test results Luka 3 13.5 oz (384g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability When we saw the Luka 3's tough build, we already imagined it wouldn't be the most breathable shoe. Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see in the video, most of the smoke comes out from the tongue; but it pales in comparison with the results the Curry 10 showed us. The 5/5 this UA model earned is pretty clear when we see its whole structure working together to evacuate the smoke. On the other hand, the Luka 3... is doing its best, and it got a solid 3/5. Still, we were pretty surprised when we saw the toebox letting out smoke just like a train! Our microscope was quick to explain why. This Jordan has small ventilation holes at the top of the forefoot and on the sides. There aren't many of them, though, but they seem to work pretty well! Who would have guessed that tiny detail is not some mere decoration? It was even hard to see in our light test! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Luka 3 3 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test We felt pretty confident during our wear tests with the Luka 3. The shoe's structure is supportive overall, and it features not only a sole flare, but also a wonderful IsoPlate detail. As you can see in the video below, our ankles didn't have a chance to play around! Your browser does not support the video tag. The flare did its part too, providing us with a wider base for stable landings after our jumps. If you're an inside player or you like to focus on rebounding, we believe this structure is going to come in handy. Why? Well, because every time you collide with another player mid-air, the flare will make sure your unstabilized landings are not that bad. As we've mentioned before, we also have the IsoPlate, which is a framing structure that we can find on the outer side of the Luka 3. It improves foot containment and adds lateral stability, which are already 2 wonderful key points for a basketball shoe. But the best part of this specific detail is that its structure spreads all around the forefoot. We do believe this added an extra pop that worked hand in hand with the shock absorption of the Cushlon 3.0 foam. Which is a great combination, if you ask us! Your browser does not support the video tag. Torsional rigidity The surefootedness we felt was not only because of the IsoPlate, though! When we took the Luka 3 to our lab and performed our torsional rigidity test... the shoe was about to break our phalanges! Your browser does not support the video tag. You can see it clearly in the video, we were trying our best to bend it! But it just wouldn't give in, which made us give it a solid 5/5 on our torsional rigidity test. There's not a higher grade... maybe we should add a \"bricklike\" category for shoes like this? Your browser does not support the video tag. Jokes aside, the high rigidity of the materials of this shoe offered us wonderful foot containment and stability. The only downside is that the Luka 3 needed a break-in period to give us all the comfort it had stored for us. It wasn't too hard or painful, and it definitely went by way more easily than the Luka 1 's. OH MY GOSH now that was a brick! Test results Luka 3 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness The Luka 3's heel is here to give us good news once again! When we tried to bend it, it didn't give in for a single second, look. Your browser does not support the video tag. Its stiff upper gave us a lot of confidence when we played ball, as it offered great heel support. Its unmovable structure is complimented by the incredibly thick heel counter, which made sure our Achilles was safe and sound. Oh, also, heel slippage was clearly out of the question! Test results Luka 3 5 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot With a wider base and a sole flare, the Luka 3 stood at 117.3 mm when we measured its midsole width in the forefoot with our caliper. Apart from the stability provided by both features, we also want to talk about the slight protuberance that protected our toes from abrasion. Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see, there are some dribble moves where us, hoopers, inevitably rub the inner side of the toebox against the court. The surface might be more or less harsh, yet it still deals some damage to the shoe, which needs to be protected! This protuberance right is shielding our toes on the outer side too, and we couldn't be more grateful! Nevertheless, just by looking at it we can tell the shoe's structure doesn't focus on this specific protection. The layer is not big, and on our Dremel test we checked the material wasn't the most durable around. Also, the design of the shoe adds some kind of gap in the middle of the more solid structure of the upper. It might be for breathability reasons, or even to reduce the shoe's overall weight. Whatever it is, just make sure harsh surfaces don't have access to it, or they will obliterate it! This is another reason why we wouldn't recommend anyone to play streetball constantly in the Luka 3. Test results Luka 3 117.3 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The midsole width in the heel is just average at 90.3 mm, according to our caliper. So there's nothing special here! But with the support that the extra padded and stiff heel counter provides, it's not like we were missing any stability features either. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Luka 3 90.3 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability The same way the Luka 3's upper made us think it wouldn't be breathable, just by looking at it we bet it would actually put up a fight against our Dremel. Your browser does not support the video tag. The tool rolled and rolled, and we saw some white material flying around, yet the toebox didn't end up all messed up! We were pretty happy with these results. Even though the shoe lost some material, it kept its integrity. Consequently, we've given the Luka 3 a solid 4/5 in our toebox durability test. It's easier to see how good a 4/5 is when we compare it to a 1/5. The poor Nike Precision 6 ended up with layers and layers of material completely destroyed! Test results Luka 3 4 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability We went all the way back to the heel to test its durability too. We're usually pretty concerned about this specific spot in basketball shoes, as it has to endure the constant friction of going up and down the court, jumping, layups, fakes, quick lateral movements..., and anything in between. Your browser does not support the video tag. That's why we need our Dremel! At 5K RPM and with a force of 3.2N, the tool goes all in to see if the heel padding is cut to be a pro player or if it'll stay as a benchwarmer. We were pretty happy about the results! It might not be absolutely perfect, but the heel showed great resistance to abrasion. That's why we decided to give it a high 4/5 on our heel padding durability test. Just look at how different these two results are. On the left we have the Luka 3, and on the right the Reebok Answer DMX . The latter scored a sad 1/5 on this same test, and you can clearly understand why just by looking at how messed up things ended up back there! Test results Luka 3 4 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness Even though we'll talk about this later on, when we put the Luka 3 upside down, we couldn't stop staring at its outsole. The Luka 1 and the Luka 2 already had translucent outsoles, yet the Luka 3 goes for the same design idea but with an extra pinch of style. Anyway, our durometer returned 88.4 HC, which means this shoe's outsole is harder than average. This usually means that the material used is more on the durable side. Let's ask our Dremel! Test results Luka 3 88.4 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability At 10K RPM and with a force of 3.2N, our Dremel attacked the Luka 3's beautiful outsole during 22 seconds. Your browser does not support the video tag. Once the fight was over, we grabbed the shoe again and measured the depth of the dent with our tread gauge. At 1.1 mm, the result is pretty close to the average. In other words, the rubber used in the Luka 3's outsole was pretty hard, so we expected it to get a score at least lower than average. Personally, we wouldn't recommend this shoe to play outdoors constantly, as its rubber might wear down sooner than expected. Test results Luka 3 1.1 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness At 4.0 mm, our caliper indicated that this Jordan's outsole thickness is just average. But we're not saying this as something bad, of course! What we mean is that the brand went for a simple and typical approach regarding the outsole. The rubber proved to be pretty hard, so using a thicker layer would just add some extra weight to the shoe... which is a no-no! Test results Luka 3 4.0 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness The brand focused on getting things simple with the insole, which was... slightly disappointing, to be honest. But wait, wait, don't come at us just yet, let us explain! The Luka 3 is not a budget shoe! For its price, we expected some Nike technologies in the midsole or a nice insole. Yet we got... a 4.2 mm one with nothing special. The only thing that we liked is that it seems to be made using recycled materials and that it's removable, which is always a plus. Test results Luka 3 4.2 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole Removable insoles are our thing, that's for sure. This means that you can use your own orthotics if needed. Or maybe just change insoles to add some extra cushioning or support! Test results Luka 3 Yes Reflective elements The Luka 3 doesn't include reflective elements, we verified it in our lab! Test results Luka 3 No Tongue padding This shoe's tongue is incredibly padded at the top, right where the laces are tied. Not only did this add some extra comfort to our instep, it also gave us the freedom to tie our laces as tight as we wanted, protecting us from any kind of hot spots! Test results Luka 3 11.8 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type Honestly, we did expect a gusseted tongue here. Both the Luka 1 and Luka 2 have semi-gusseted tongues, so... what happened with the 3, Nike? It's true that there's a loop that reassures the whole fit, structuring up the lacing system. Despite our love for this and for that extra eyelet at the top, which gives us the possibility to go for a runner's knot, we would have been happier if this newest version had at least a semi-gusseted tongue. It's not like we're not satisfied with the Luka 3's lockdown feel. But you know, even if a gusseted or semi-gusseted tongue meant some extra weight, it's also an appropriate feature for a shoe with this price. Test results Luka 3 None Heel tab No finger loop, no pull tab, no nothing. The Luka 3 keeps its aesthetics clean with just a couple of details at the back! We really liked the brand's touch adding different logos in the heel. In the right shoe, we've got the Jumpman, and in the left shoe, Luka's own logo. Super cool!

It performed incredibly well and got fantastic scores in our lab and wear tests! Its upper mixes durability and breathability perfectly, which allows us to play non-stop even on the hottest days of the summer. But there's more: its quality materials offer great support and stability for unexpected moves! Overall, we believe this shoe is fantastic for hoopers with a quick playstyle thanks to its lightweight design and low-profile nature, as we could feel the court under our feet. Nevertheless, its midsole and insole are pretty simple, which means no cool Nike technologies around!

You should definitely have a look at this king of the quality-price ratio if you're looking for: A breathable model to hoop in the summer. An incredibly durable and pretty supportive companion to play ball all day long. A lightweight shoe with a low profile that suits guards' playstyle (quick footwork time!). A budget model that doesn't feel like one! Who should not buy The Precision 7 performed incredibly well in our lab and wear tests, to the point we almost couldn't believe it was a budget pair. Nevertheless, its lack of Nike technologies gave it away! If you're looking for a shoe with better cushioning, the LeBron Witness 7 is a model from a more affordable line of LeBron. It features a large Max Air unit in its midsole, offering outstanding impact protection. Your browser does not support the video tag. As a low-cost model, the Precision 7 doesn't really focus on a specific basketball position. Its low profile, close to the ground, and lightweight nature make it great for guards; yet it doesn't have any Air Units or Zoom Turbo to energise these players' moves and dribbles. If you're looking for those extra technological details that make the difference and you don't mind paying a bit more, we believe you should have a look at some other signature shoes like James Harden models , LeBron pairs , or Giannis kicks . Disclaimer: This is NOT the EasyOn version of the Nike Precision 7! The EasyOn iteration features a collapsible heel that bends easily and comfortably when you put it on. Consequently, this has a negative effect on the overall support and containment of the shoe. Please, keep this in mind if you're going to buy the Precision 7. Cushioning Shock absorption New Nike proves that a sub-$100 shoe doesn't have to feel like a hard brick underfoot. We are happy to report that the Precision 7 offers a solid level of cushioning and impact protection even with its below-average stack height! Our shock absorption tests returned 102 SA in its heel and 79 SA in the forefoot, confirming that this budget-friendly shoe is on par with the category average. An all-game comfort for sure! Heel Forefoot Test results Precision 7 102 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New With just a full-length EVA foam (presumably Phylon) and a small midfoot shank, the Precision 7 managed to reach the energy return of the more expensive hoop shoes! At 58.5% in the heel and 61.3% in the forefoot, it proved to be on par with the category average. While it's not an explosive shoe, it feels pleasantly dynamic and responsive to promote snappy toe-offs, jump shots, and dribbles. Heel Forefoot Test results Precision 7 61.3% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack At 27.3 mm, this shoe's heel stack is slightly lower than average. Which means our feet were closer to the ground during our wear tests. We could definitely feel this, and we appreciated this structure when we went for precise moves, as it allowed us to be more in control. Test results Precision 7 27.3 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack The forefoot is also a bit lower than average, but the v7's stack height is very similar to the v6's. So there are not many changes to mention here. At 20.9 mm, we could feel the court pretty well under our toes. Test results Precision 7 20.9 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop At 6.4 mm, this shoe's heel-to-toe drop is a tad bit lower than average but most ballers won't notice the difference. Test results Precision 7 6.4 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. When we want to measure the softness of a shoe's midsole, we need to cut it in half. First of all, we need to be able to access the material. Then, we grab our durometer and press it against it until it shows a number. At 27.1 HA, the Nike Precision 7's midsole foam is moderately firm. It's a bit harder than the average, but it's not something we actually noticed that much on our feet during our wear tests. Your browser does not support the video tag. You can see it clearly in this video. It's not the plushest shoe out there, but we can't actually say it's super hard either! It felt just right in our feet, so we'd call it balanced. Test results Precision 7 27.1 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Nike Precision 7 fits slightly small (62 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit The Nike Precision 7 is a pretty close-fitting hoop shoe which caters to players with medium-to-narrow feet. Your browser does not support the video tag. The shoe's interior gel replica proved this to be true with a below-average width of 90.4 mm. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Precision 7 90.4 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width The shoe also has a more noticeable taper angle than its counterparts with a narrower width of 67.1 mm near the big toe. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Precision 7 67.1 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height Its vertical space is not very abundant either. Measuring the shoe's toebox height, our caliper showed only 21.5 mm. Because the toebox fabric is not very stretchy either, some people might experience pressure, especially during the break-in period. Test results Precision 7 21.5 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New The grip of this Nike shoe proved to be consistent and showed a good friction score of 0.70. It's not the tackiest outsole but it is perfect for a budget-friendly shoe like the Precision 7. Test results Precision 7 0.70 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New The Precision 7 has an etched herringbone-inspired pattern which makes the shoe suitable for streetball as well. Flexibility / Stiffness New In our flexibility test, we measure how much force a shoe requires to bend to a 30-degree angle. And as it turns out, the Nike Precision 7 needs significantly less force than its counterparts! At only 16.0N, it happens to be a very agreeable hoop shoe which allowed us to bend the foot very easily in the forefoot. This, in turn, resulted in pretty smooth heel-to-toe transitions and a comfortable (albeit not so snappy) in-shoe experience. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Precision 7 16.0N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight When we grabbed the Precision 7 to take it out of its box, we realised how effortless our movements were. This shoe felt really light in our hands, and we couldn't wait to hear what our feet had to say about it! Well, they agreed! We felt really quick playing with these Nikes. That's why we believe it's a great model for guards and forwards who rely on their fast footwork to overtake their opponents. So our hands and our feet totally agreed, but what about our scale? At 11.6 oz/329.0g it couldn't be more on our side! This incredibly low score makes the Precision 7 an incredibly 17% lighter than average. Trust us, for such a resistant shoe, this score is absolutely wonderful! But that's not all. The previous iteration was also heavier at 12.03 oz/341g, yet its upper was less durable and less breathable. Talk about meaningful improvements, Nike has surpassed itself once again with this budget shoe! Test results Precision 7 11.6 oz (329g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability Most basketball shoes focus on being protective, and thus, durability overpowers breathability. After all, the tougher the materials are, the less air they usually let through..., right? Your browser does not support the video tag. Wow! Well, it seems we're off to a good start! Look at all that smoke coming out of the Precision 7. It didn't even have to get some steam up to get a fantastic score of 5/5 (yeah, yeah, pun intended). Also, if we compare it with the Reebok Shaq Attaq , which got a sad 1/5 in this same test, the Precision 7's ventilation capabilities are even more impressive. Thanks to our microscope, we could see the materials of its upper closer. In the picture, we can see a thin protective layer and some mesh. The material itself already looked breathable despite not having any pores or holes to let the air go in and out. Your browser does not support the video tag. We verified this by putting half of the upper right in front of a light. We couldn't see any openings in the mesh material, but that didn't stop this model from getting a perfect score in breathability. What a kill! This is so unusual for basketball shoes, we were so happy to see a Nike model that breaks the norm! Test results Precision 7 5 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test This shoe's materials and structure give in a little bit, and that can be seen in our lateral stability test. Your browser does not support the video tag. But we didn't feel unstable (as we'll discuss later on when we talk about its torsional rigidity and platform width). Our feet were well-planted on its base, and its durable materials made sure we felt surefooted. The v7's containment was way better than the v6's. We really appreciated that, as we felt way safer during our games. That was the key point to try more daring moves in our playtests. Your browser does not support the video tag. All in all, the Precision 7 is definitely stable enough to hoop comfortably, as its sidewalls add extra points to that category. Yeah, it's a budget shoe, but it performed incredibly well in our lab and wear tests! Torsional rigidity Our fingers had to put a lot of effort into bending this shoe. And even after that, it wouldn't give in much! Your browser does not support the video tag. This levels up the foot containment, which means we were feeling safe and sound playing with these Nikes. The upper materials hugged our feet comfortably and gave them the support they needed to try harder dribbles and powerful steps. Consequently, it earned a 4/5 in our torsional rigidity test. Your browser does not support the video tag. To perform backdoor cuts or any other kind of explosive in-n-out move, we need our feet to be supported. We cannot risk getting injured, but we also need some flex from the shoe. There are some players who like the feeling of their ankles being wrapped in a snug fit, but it's true that many of them prefer some kind of freedom. That lets the joint adapt to your performance better and follow your moves closely without feeling constricted. Test results Precision 7 4 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness In the heel counter stiffness is where we've seen a massive improvement compared to the previous iteration. Your browser does not support the video tag. It was hard for our fingers to bend it, so we gave it a well-deserved 4/5 in stiffness. This improved the shoe's overall support by leaps and bounds. It was one of the main drawbacks of the v6, as its ankle support was non-existent. This naturally made us feel less confident on the court, which is something a hooper should NOT experience! Look, this is a video from the Nike Precision 6 . It got a 2/5 on our heel counter stiffness test, which means it's way more flexible than the next iteration. Your browser does not support the video tag. We can clearly see that shoe might lack the support needed for some hoopers. If you play basketball in a more serious way, we believe the v7 is way more suitable when we're talking about containment and ankle safety! Test results Precision 7 4 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot To take its stability to a whole new level, Nike decided to give the Precision 7 an incredibly wide midsole in the forefoot. At 120.2 mm, our feet enjoyed this shoe's spacious and substantial base. We love this kind of design in basketball models, as it makes jumping way easier and much better. Even if we believe the Precision 7 suits guards better, we loved going for rebounds and performing layups with it. A wide base equals stable landings. And we're loving it! Test results Precision 7 120.2 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel At 90.3 mm, its midsole width in the heel is average. But don't worry, this reading does not mean that the Precision 7 has lost any stability. The shoe itself is still very stable, and this part being average instead of more on the wider side only adds extra points to the snug fit of its heel. Your browser does not support the video tag. All good here, chief! Test results Precision 7 90.3 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability There are many times when breathability and durability are mutually exclusive. When you go for tough materials, as we mentioned before, they usually don't let the air go through very easily. And then the other way around, where very breathable materials tend to be thinner and less durable. The Nike Precision 7? Oh, that's another story. It is getting the best of both worlds, and we love it! Your browser does not support the video tag. Our Dremel struggled in this fight, look at that! Just a mere aesthetically unpleasing scratch. Can we even say that's a scratch? If we didn't have the video of the tool actually roll-roll-rolling all the way into the upper, we would have thought we hit a small branch with it or something. On the left, the Nike Precision 7 and its fantastic 5/5 in our toebox durability test. On the right, the previous iteration, the Nike Precision 6 , and its scary 1/5 in this same test. We are very happy to tell you that this latest iteration has not only improved in breathability, but also in durability! Test results Precision 7 5 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability We moved our Dremel all the way back to the heel to test its durability. Let's see if this generally fragile part puts up a fight! Your browser does not support the video tag. Not bad, not bad! The heel didn't end up crying for mercy, so we're pretty happy with this result too! This is what it looked like after the 4-second drilling session at 5K RPM and 3.2N. We decided to give it a solid 3/5 in heel padding durability, which is pretty close to the average. The Reebok Answer DMX was not as lucky. That's what a 1/5 in heel padding durability (on the right) looks like. What a mess! Test results Precision 7 3 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness At 88.0 HC, our durometer indicated this shoe's outsole is harder than average. This usually means that the material is more durable. Yet the score was not so high to say it would lose traction. That's our prediction! But we're here to spit facts based on actual lab and wear tests, so let's keep the party going! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Precision 7 88.0 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability Our Dremel's last main character moment is finally here. We grabbed the tool and started digging the outsole to see if it was actually as durable as its hard rubber indicated. Your browser does not support the video tag. Well... we could actually see the material flying around a little bit, but it didn't look so bad. Let's see the final picture! We used our tread gauge to see how deep the damage was, and it turns out it's just average. At 0.9 mm, we can't say this is the most durable outsole out there! Nevertheless, it would withstand a game or two of streetball. Here you have some other models on our catalog that are ready to resist outdoor courts' abrasive surfaces . Test results Precision 7 0.9 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness When our caliper returned 4.4 mm, we nodded in agreement. The rubber used in the Nike Precision 7's outsole is hard enough for this part not to be super thick. This also helps reducing the shoe's overall weight, which is always great! Test results Precision 7 4.4 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness At 4.8 mm, our durometer indicated that this shoe's insole is slightly thicker than average. This made the shoe a bit more comfortable overall, but there's nothing special to comment on. So let's move on! Test results Precision 7 4.8 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole Removable insoles are almost a must, and these Nikes know it well! We don't actually have any specific complaints about it, but the Precision 7's insole is just simple. Nothing special, you see. It does its job and that's it. So if you want to change it, it'll be easy peasy! Test results Precision 7 Yes Reflective elements We didn't expect a budget shoe to have any reflective elements, and we were totally right! Test results Precision 7 No Tongue padding The Precision 7's thickly padded tongue is the crowning touch to its surefooted feel. At 10.5 mm, our caliper confirmed what our feet felt: even more comfort! We could forget about lace bite or any other kind of uncomfortable rub when we played with this shoe. Your browser does not support the video tag. The best part? That these Nikes' lightweight nature wasn't affected by its extra padded structure! Test results Precision 7 10.5 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type When we were reviewing this model in the lab, we had to remind ourselves multiple times that it's supposed to be a budget shoe! With a fully gusseted tongue, the Nike Precision 7 stands its ground as a hooper with wonderful value. This reinforcement and the 4/5 it scored in our heel counter stiffness and torsional rigidity tests made sure we felt supported during our games. We felt surefooted with its snug fit, and we felt its spacious nature complimented it perfectly to make the whole shoe even more comfortable. Nike, you've surpassed yourself yet again! Test results Precision 7 Both sides (full) Heel tab This model doesn't include a finger loop or a pull-tab, but its heel still offered us some help to put it on! As you can see in the picture, the Precision 7 includes an extended heel collar. It looks like a pointy elf ear, and we could easily grab it to put the shoe on. We really liked this detail, as it doesn't just fit the shoe's whole vibe, it also makes it easier for us to be ready to hoop in the blink of an eye! The Precision 7 closing system gets its final touch with a slightly asymmetrical loop structure and its textured laces. This more traditional piece with an unconventional style doesn't just look good, it also works wonders for the shoe's snug feel!

Also, players who move a lot on the court and require a light basketball companion may have to look elsewhere. The Reebok Answer IV ,1.8 oz lighter, is a fantastic alternative. Cushioning Heel stack In the lab, we saw that the heel tooling is just as thick as what we usually see in hoop shoes. To be more specific, our caliper measured it to be 31.4 mm thick. What makes this part of the shoe noteworthy is the Hexalite technology that's embedded in it. This add-on helped with impact protection without putting on so much thickness. However, those who really want well-pronounced impact protection are still going to be happier with the LeBron 20 from Nike . Test results Question Mid 31.4 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack Just like the heel area, the forefoot is also just around the average when it comes to thickness. Our caliper measured it to be 21.1 mm thick. We got to enjoy a decent amount of court feel through this setup. Test results Question Mid 21.1 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop Based on the stack measurements above, we measured the shoe's drop to be 10.3 mm. Having such an elevated heel made our landings feel very well cushioned. Test results Question Mid 10.3 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. At 30.3 HA, the shoe's cushioning foam is definitely on the firmer side. This firm tooling allowed us to gain control over our movements, no matter how fine they might have been. Test results Question Mid 30.3 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Reebok Question Mid fits true to size (17 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit Upon weartesting, the Reebok Question Mid felt true to size for our medium-width feet. Your browser does not support the video tag. But when we took the gel mold out of the shoe and measured its dimensions with a caliper, we found that it is even a little wider than average at 94.1 mm. But that's not enough to tag this Reebok shoe as wide. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Question Mid 94.1 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width There is a pretty big contrast between the shoe's wide metatarsal area and the pointy toebox shape. Measuring its width near the big toe at 67.2 mm confirmed that its taper angle is more aggressive than average. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Question Mid 67.2 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height At least the shoe's vertical space remains adequate in the toe area. We got a standard toebox height of 22.1 mm in the Question Mid. Test results Question Mid 22.1 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Flexibility / Stiffness In the lab, we gauge a shoe's flexibility by measuring how much force is needed for it to bend at 90 degrees. We found that this Reebok hoop shoe needed 41.7N, which is just around the average. The average flexibility is not something to complain about, really. We felt that it gave just the right combo of support and freedom of movement. This shoe follows methodology 1.8. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Question Mid 41.7N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight If there was something that we didn't like so much about this Reebok shoe, it would be its weight. At 16.9 ounces or 479 grams, it is significantly heavier than the typical hoop shoe. Because of its heaviness, our first steps were often an effort to make. Test results Question Mid 16.9 oz (479g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability The Reebok Question Mid is a strong pick when it comes to breathability. This Nike shoe scored a 4 out of 5 from us when we saw that its upper material easily allowed smoke (hence, air) to pass through and escape. This rating makes this shoe better than most basketball shoes on record. Your browser does not support the video tag. Reebok Question Mid (4 out of 5) vs Under Armour Curry 10 (5 out of 5) In our light assessment, we saw that light shines through the numerous vents in the mesh tongue. Your browser does not support the video tag. Using a microscope we got a closer look at the mesh and the perforations that contributed greatly to this shoe's breathability. The holes can be clearly seen in the closeup shot below. Test results Question Mid 4 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test The sidewalls are made of materials that offer just enough flexibility to provide support without being too restrictive. They made us more confident to do side-to-side movements and even make swift changes in direction. Torsional rigidity Because of the rigidity of the base, running in this hoop shoe felt safe. Twisting our feet became the least of our worries. When manually assessed in the lab, we were left with no other choice but to give it a solid 4 out of 5 for torsional resistance. Test results Question Mid 4 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness Upon giving it a good squeeze, we felt that the heel counter was not too flimsy and not too stiff either. It truly deserves the 3 out of 5 that we gave it for its stiffness. On feet, the heel counter gave a balance of lockdown and some level of flexibility. Test results Question Mid 3 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot We felt totally stable while wearing the Reebok Question Mid because its platform was seriously wide. It opens 115.4 mm in the forefoot, providing enough space for splays and inevitable shifts when in motion. Test results Question Mid 115.4 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The heel area of the platform is amazingly a lot wider than average at 96.9 mm.  Given this much space, it's virtually impossible to slide off the footbed! Not once did we have to worry about painful foot twists. Test results Question Mid 96.9 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability The Question Mid offers a good deal of durability. While our 12-second Dremel test eroded the colored first layer of the toebox, it barely made a dent in the next layer. This result gives us more confidence in this shoe's longevity.

Reebok Question Mid (4 out of 5) vs Adidas Harden Stepback 3 (3 out of 5) Test results Question Mid 4 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability Amazing. This word perfectly summarizes the durability of the heel counter padding after getting a perfect 5 in our durability test. Your browser does not support the video tag. If only it could, the heel counter padding might have already been laughing at the Dremel test we performed on it. The test did not even leave any noticeable marks! Test results Question Mid 5 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness To the touch, the outsole of the Reebok Question Mid felt really firm. And this made us feel exceptionally confident playing on an outdoor court, even on a harsh asphalt one! When we used the HC durometer to assess the hardness of the outsole more objectively, we learned that it is indeed harder than average at 89.9 HC. This is by far one of the hardest rubbers in our lab! Test results Question Mid 89.9 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability We subjected the outsole to 22 seconds of high-pressure Dremel drilling. Your browser does not support the video tag. The resulting dent of 0.9 mm is slightly lower than average. Given this result, we can say that this shoe is OK for occasional outdoor use. Test results Question Mid 0.9 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness At 4.8 mm based on our caliper measurements, the outsole of the Reebok Question Mid is slightly thicker than average. This only increased our confidence in using this shoe outdoors once in a while. But if playing outdoors is more the rule than the exception, the Nike Cosmic Unity 3 offers a better experience. Test results Question Mid 4.8 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness At 4.5 mm, the removable insole of the Reebok Question Mid is just as thick as any other insole. We just appreciate the sponginess and comfort that it made us feel when we were stepping on it. Test results Question Mid 4.5 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole The spongy insole is a removable feature of the Reebok Question Mid, allowing some versatility should there be a need to wear orthotics during a game. Test results Question Mid Yes Tongue padding Being 14.3 mm thick, we can really say that the tongue is generously padded. Not only did the thick tongue provide comfort on top of the foot but it also enhanced the overall fit and lockdown of the shoe. Test results Question Mid 14.3 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type The non-gusseted design of the Reebok Question Mid allowed us to move more freely. Additionally, the unattached tongue also helped with ventilation. Test results Question Mid None Heel tab This basketball shoe from Reebok has no heel tab whatsoever. Fortunately, this is not an issue in our experience because it was quite easy to put on and take off this shoe.

For a fair price, you get pretty good cushioning (plus an Air Max unit at the heel!) and fantastic traction even on dusty courts. Its upper durability is much better, yet that didn't make it any less comfortable thanks to all its padding. Listening to all of us hoopers, Nike added reinforced and structural layers to this newest model to improve containment and support. Nevertheless, during our wear tests we didn't find it stable enough to perform riskier moves.

Sometimes you play on dusty courts and you need a hooper that offers great traction. You don't want to sell a kidney to get your next pair of basketball shoes . Who should NOT buy If you need your shoes to have some extra stability or you have/have had ankle issues of any type, we kindly ask you to stay away from the Witness 8. Even though it has improved its containment in comparison to the previous iteration , in our experience it wasn't enough. We have reviewed many other models that focus on ankle support , which might be a much better choice for you if you're looking for some extra safety! Your browser does not support the video tag. If you're not on a budget and you want a top-tier performer from LeBron, the LB 21 and the LB 22 's playability is just wonderful, and both of them feature a durable outsole that can withstand the abrasion of outdoor courts (anyways, here you have some other hoopers to play streetball just in case). Cushioning Shock absorption New Packing a large Air Max unit into its midsole didn't add a ton of cushioning to the LeBron Witness 8. In fact, it showed some of the lowest shock absorption measurements of 87 SA in the heel! That's not very much impact protection for the big guys out there... Surprisingly, the forefoot of this Nike shoe showed an above-average reading of 88 SA with nothing but Phylon under the toes. However, that didn't help to make this budget LeBron shoe feel any cushier overall. Heel Forefoot Test results LeBron Witness 8 87 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New But there is some good news too - the ride of the Witness 8 turned out to be pretty responsive and dynamic, with standard energy return measurements of 59% in the heel and 60.3% in the forefoot. The shoe has good rebound for take-offs, blocks, crossovers, drives, and other powerful moves. Heel Forefoot Test results LeBron Witness 8 60.3% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack At 32.1 mm, this LeBron's heel stack is higher than average. It features an Air Max unit at the rearfoot that offers some bounce and impact protection. Nothing spectacular, but we aren't complaining about it either. Test results LeBron Witness 8 32.1 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack There's also a substantial amount of cushioning at the forefoot. Our caliper returned 22.8 mm, surpassing the average of this category once again. Test results LeBron Witness 8 22.8 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop The full-length Phylon foam used in the Witness 8 hugs a big Max Air unit at the heel. That's why this shoe's drop goes all the way up to 9.3 mm, which is neither good nor bad! Your rearfoot will just feel slightly higher, but this doesn't affect performance or playability negatively at all. Apart from this Nike technology at the back, this LeBron pair also features a shank at the midfoot. It's the black line you can see right in the middle of the shoe, and it improves its overall support and structure. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results LeBron Witness 8 9.3 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. When we measured the softness of this shoe's midsole, our durometer marked 35.0 HA. As this result is way higher than average, the Phylon foam used also feels harder! Nevertheless, as the Max Air unit offers some impact protection, easing this feel and making landings smoother. Test results LeBron Witness 8 35.0 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Nike LeBron Witness 8 fits half size small (244 votes). Consider sizing up Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit Measuring the interiors of a shoe accurately is not an easy task at all! After giving it some thought and doing many tests, we finally created a gel, which is the green thing you can see in the video below. Your browser does not support the video tag. We pour it into every shoe, freeze it, and then create a mold that we can measure in the lab with a caliper. In this case, the tool marked 92.3 mm, which is pretty much average. Test results LeBron Witness 8 92.3 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width We measure the width once again, but this time at the big toe. Our caliper returned 72.4 mm, surpassing the average and making us nod in approval. The Witness 8 doesn't taper like crazy despite being a Nike pair, and our toes were really grateful! Test results LeBron Witness 8 72.4 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height The upper of the Witness 8 sits pretty low at the toebox, though. When we measured the vertical height in this area, our caliper marked 20.1 mm, which is not much compared to the average. The issue here is that this newest iteration has substantially reinforced its upper with multiple layers in comparison to the Witness 7 , so don't expect it to be that stretchy. Test results LeBron Witness 8 20.1 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New Even though it's a budget-friendly offering, the LeBron Witness 8 carries The King's name and doesn't fall short of outsole traction. Our grip testing setup recorded a solid friction score of 0.74 when sliding this shoe against a professional court surface. It is an excellent result for an affordable hoop shoe! Test results LeBron Witness 8 0.74 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New When one traction pattern doesn't cut it, Nike uses three! Three different tread designs make up the Witness 8's outsole to provide stopping power and grip in multiple directions. Flexibility / Stiffness New With a moderate flexibility measurement of 21.3N, the LeBron Witness 8 walks a fine line between stiffness and give. It's an optimal setup that doesn’t restrict the movement but is not too forgiving to cause instability either. It is a bonus point to the shoe's versatility. New test (recommended) Old test Test results LeBron Witness 8 21.3N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight Despite its looks, the Witness 8 didn't feel excessively heavy during our wear tests. We didn't really notice that much difference in comparison to the previous model on foot, but when we took it to the lab, our scale marked a lower result. At 13.26 oz/376g, this newest iteration is on the lighter side of our hoopers category. We can't say it's a speedy shoe, as we didn't really find its structure safe enough to perform the fastest cuts or changes of direction. Nevertheless, we appreciate the brand's effort: it made it more supportive than the 7th and, somehow, it also managed to reduce its overall weight! Test results LeBron Witness 8 13.3 oz (376g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability All the added layering in order to reinforce the upper took a toll on this shoe's breathability. The Witness 7 and its softer materials scored a 4/5 on this test, yet the 8th only managed to get a 2/5. Your browser does not support the video tag. Our light test was a clear indicator of what was coming. The LED could shine through a small section of the toebox, yet the smoke didn't have it easy on its way out! In comparison to the Ja 2 , the Witness 8 definitely felt hot on foot. Your browser does not support the video tag. We believe the brand did what it could to fix the containment and stability issues of the previous model, and it looks like that meant sacrificing breathability. This reinforced upper offered more structure, but just by looking at it through our microscope, you can definitely tell it's not gonna offer the best ventilation out there. Test results LeBron Witness 8 2 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test In our experience, the Witness 7 doesn't offer much lateral support at all. Its materials were way too soft for that, and even though this 8th iteration has improved that... we still didn't feel the safest playing with it. It wiggles a lot, and if we put our weight all to the outer side, it felt like our ankles could snap in a hot minute. Your browser does not support the video tag. Torsional rigidity When we took this hooper to our lab, it was surprisingly hard for our fingers to twist it. Even though it didn't feel like the most stable on foot, its structure didn't let us play with it. Your browser does not support the video tag. That's why we believe it's so important to not only analyze the shoes in our lab, but also put them on to play basketball for a while. Even though the Witness 8 scored a 5/5 on our torsional rigidity test, its foothold is definitely not the firmest we've tried so far. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results LeBron Witness 8 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness This LeBron scored a 3/5 on our heel counter stiffness test. Even though its support and containment overall are nothing crazy, there has definitely been improvement in comparison with the previous iteration . Nike listened to the hoopers' complaints, so this shoe feels definitely safer. Still, we would not recommend it to people with stability needs or ankle issues of any kind. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results LeBron Witness 8 3 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot The wider the midsole, the more stable the shoe. And that's it, we don't make the rules! We believe the Witness 8 could've gotten some extra points in this aspect if its landing base had been wider, yet our caliper marked only 111.8 mm, which is smaller than average. Test results LeBron Witness 8 111.8 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The heel is even narrower, at only 84.0 mm... which is actually lower than the Witness 7 's score on this same test! Taking into account the stability issues of this previous iteration, it took us completely by surprise. But it might just be a strategy from the brand to reduce the overall weight of this hooper, though. Test results LeBron Witness 8 84.0 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability Even though this shoe's breathability left much to be desired, it improved a lot on durability. At 5K RPM and with 2N of force, the Dremel couldn't really do much to its armor-like upper, so we decided to give it a 4/5 on this test. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results LeBron Witness 8 4 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability The heel fought just as bravely. As you can see in the video below, the tool couldn't do much to damage this shoe's padding, so we decided to give it another 4/5 on durability. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results LeBron Witness 8 4 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness Our durometer marked 78.0 HC when we analyzed this shoe's outsole hardness. This score is lower than average, and it might mean that the rubber used focuses more on traction than on durability. Test results LeBron Witness 8 78.0 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability We confirmed our previous hypothesis when we turned on the Dremel one last time. With the same 2N of force but this time at 10K RPM, it drilled the Witness 8's outsole mercilessly during 18 seconds. Your browser does not support the video tag. When we measured the dent, our tread gauge returned 1.6 mm, which is fairly higher than the average for the hoopers we have reviewed so far . Therefore, abrasive surfaces might destroy this pair sooner than what you'd like. Test results LeBron Witness 8 1.6 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness Once we had cut this shoe in half, we could measure its outsole thickness. Its 4.0 mm make it just average, so it's not like the Witness 8 has loads of rubber to wear out before it gives up. Test results LeBron Witness 8 4.0 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness The 5.0 mm thick insole doesn't do much, as it's pretty standard, but we did find it more comfortable than other thinner orthotics. Test results LeBron Witness 8 5.0 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole If you need or want to use your own orthotics, this LeBron makes it easy, as it features a removable insole that you can change at any moment. Test results LeBron Witness 8 Yes Reflective elements There are no reflective elements in the LeBron Witness 8, but it's not like we expected it to have any, as it's part of the player's budget line. Test results LeBron Witness 8 No Tongue padding The 7.7 mm of padding this shoe has at the tongue were enough to protect us from any lace bite and offer comfort at the same time. One of the things that we liked about this hooper's design is that it's fairly padded overall, which makes it really comfortable, yet this doesn't translate in any extra weight. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results LeBron Witness 8 7.7 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type The tongue is fully gusseted, and it mixes with the upper to create some kind of bootie construction. Even though this adds support most of the times, we can't say that's what we felt when we put on the Witness 8 during our wear tests. Test results LeBron Witness 8 Both sides (full) Price As a budget shoe from the LeBron line, we do believe you get a fairly good cushioning and traction, as well as Nike's Air Maz technology, for the price. Nevertheless, the Witness 8 costs $110, and there are many other models for a similar price that offer better support and containment (like the Luka 2 or the All Pro Nitro ). To us, those are 2 key features to go all out whilst playing basketball and bring out your best performance. Test results LeBron Witness 8 $110 Average $135 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes $70 Price $210 Heel tab This Nike pair doesn't have a heel tab. Nevertheless, and despite having a fully gusseted tongue, we didn't have any problems putting it on and off.

Its incredible support and stability favor hoopers with a quick playstyle. As it maintains the same design of its predecessors, it's very versatile, so it suits any position. We believe its affordability makes it a great option for a wide public, but it might not have enough impact protection for heavy players or big centers who focus on rebounding and constant jumping.

A speedy Nike pair with a design that focuses on stability (it's low-cost but it has a shank!). A versatile and affordable shoe that suits every position when you play basketball. Who should not buy If you're looking forward to playing streetball non-stop, forget about the Giannis Immortality 4. Its outsole won't last as long as you'd want it to, and you'll find yourself buying a new pair of shoes sooner than expected. These are the best models to play outdoors that have come to our lab. Your browser does not support the video tag. Even though this Nike pair is really versatile and it suits any position, we believe heavy players or big, aggressive centers would be happier with a wider pair that has some extra impact protection. Among our affordable hoopers, we believe the Nike GT Cut Academy and the Adidas Harden Stepback 3 might be 2 of the best choices. Cushioning Shock absorption New The Renew foam's excellent cushioning properties help to make the Immortality 4 an excellent value for money. Our lab tests confirmed that the shock absorption it delivers in both the heel (101 SA) and the forefoot (87 SA) measures up to the category average, including the more expensive hoop shoes. This Nike shoe keeps landings and drives well-cushioned, no matter how long the game lasts. Heel Forefoot Test results Giannis Immortality 4 101 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New But don't expect much bounce from the Renew foam as it turned out to be quite dull and muted in the Immortality 4. With below-average energy return measurements of 51.1% in the heel and 54.5% in the forefoot, there is not much springback in this Nike shoe. Heel Forefoot Test results Giannis Immortality 4 54.5% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack At 30.0 mm according to our caliper, this shoe's heel stack is just average. Test results Giannis Immortality 4 30.0 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack The forefoot stack goes up to 24.6 mm, which is higher than average. It offers added protection under the toes and the ball of the foot but detracts from the court feel. Test results Giannis Immortality 4 24.6 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop The difference between the shoe's heel and the forefoot stacks is not too high, resulting in a below-average drop of 5.4 mm. This offset makes the shoe feel pretty flat. Not super flat in the sense that it doesn't have any cushioning, but more like our heel and toes were on the same level. Test results Giannis Immortality 4 5.4 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. The Giannis Immortality 4 features a full-length Renew foam for its midsole cushioning. Even though it's not the softest foam out there, scoring 25.5 HA on our durometer reading, it felt comfortable and stable to us, which are 2 key points too! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Giannis Immortality 4 25.5 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Nike Giannis Immortality 4 fits half size small (155 votes). Consider sizing up Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit Having created a mold of the shoe's interiors with a proprietary gel, we were able to measure its internal dimensions precisely with a caliper. Your browser does not support the video tag. In the widest part of the mold, our caliper recorded a slightly below-average width of 91.6 mm. However, it is still within the medium-width range so there is nothing to worry about if you have average-width feet. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Giannis Immortality 4 91.6 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width The non-pointy shape of this Nike shoe felt accommodating for all five toes. Our caliper measured a standard width of 69.0 mm in the big toe area. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Giannis Immortality 4 69.0 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height We didn't lack any vertical space in the Giannis Immortality 4 either. It has a decent toebox height of 22.1 mm. Test results Giannis Immortality 4 22.1 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New A fast and grippy shoe for less than $100? Shut up and take my money! The Immortality 4 showed a fantastic friction score of 0.74 in our grip test, proving to be on par with the hoop shoes twice its price! Looks like Nike fulfilled its promise of improving the shoe's traction 'to Giannis’ standards.' Test results Giannis Immortality 4 0.74 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New The Giannis Immortality 4 features a mix of long and dashed lines that are positioned at different angles for multidirectional traction. Two large flex grooves (one in the forefoot and one in the heel) set this Nike shoe apart from other hoop shoes. They add flexibility not only longitudinally (forward/back) but also laterally (side-to-side), making the sole more responsive to micromovements of the foot. In turn, this enhances the shoe's bite on he court. Flexibility / Stiffness New At 20.8N, it takes just as much force to bend the Immortality 4 to a 30-degree angle as it takes an average basketball shoe. This translated into smooth transitions for running up and down the court. Despite the shoe's high torsional rigidity and heel stiffness, it offered enough give to let our feet flex easily for pivots and fakes. This, plus the court feel, plus the overall lighter weight of the shoe, makes it pretty quick on foot. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Giannis Immortality 4 20.8N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight During our wear tests, this hooper felt pretty speedy. It let us go for quick cuts and fast breaks in the blink of an eye, which means it didn't drag our feet down when we were playing. Overall, the on-foot feel was great, especially for those of us with a lively playstyle. We understood it all when we took it to our lab and our scale returned 12.6 oz/356.0g. The Giannis Immortality 4 is lighter than average, and our foot could tell! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Giannis Immortality 4 12.6 oz (356g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability We use our light to see if the shoes have any visible ventilation holes throughout their upper. Your browser does not support the video tag. But... no luck with this one! The light couldn't shine through a single area of this hooper. Still, this doesn't necessarily mean the Giannis Immortality 4 will let your feet choke. Let's see what our smoke machine has to offer. Your browser does not support the video tag. Well, compared to the Curry 10 , which is a beast regarding breathability, this Nike model didn't shine that much. Nevertheless, after a couple of seconds you can see a constant smoke column coming through the base of the tongue. So, great news! Its toebox might not be well-ventilated, but the tongue tries its best to compensate for it. Our microscope knows this well: the Giannis Immortality 4's tightly woven upper wouldn't let the air get through easily! Consequently, we have decided to give this shoe an standard 3/5 on our breathability test. Test results Giannis Immortality 4 3 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Overall, during our wear tests playing basketball in this shoe, we felt confident and safe. Your browser does not support the video tag. Even though its upper materials are not the toughest ones out there, they didn't let our heel overextend its moves. Nevertheless, to us, it was the midsole width and the sole flares the ones that helped the most regarding stability. We landed safely after shooting and even after grabbing a harsh rebound in traffic! Your browser does not support the video tag. This Nike pair also features a top-loaded shank in the midfoot. It offers extra support alongside the thickly padded heel counter, collar, and tongue, making this shoe's lockdown absolutely extraordinary. But that's not all, as this Nike hooper also features an internal double-layered containment system that keeps leveling up our lock-in feel. Your browser does not support the video tag. Torsional rigidity The tall midsole of this Nike didn't let our fingers twist it like, at all. So we surrendered and decided to give it a 5/5 in this test. Your browser does not support the video tag. Its rigid materials offered us a wonderful lock-in feel. If we follow our experience and compare this shoe to its previous version, there's no doubt this one offers better foot containment. This translates into our feet feeling safer and, at the same time, that translates into us trying more daring moves during our wear tests! Test results Giannis Immortality 4 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness The heel understood the assignment, as it was impossible for us to bend it. Your browser does not support the video tag. Exactly, that just looks like another 5/5 in stiffness! The Giannis Immortality 4's super thick heel counter is a wall that won't cooperate, so our thumb had to give up on trying to make it bow. Test results Giannis Immortality 4 5 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot Time for our caliper to make an announcement: we have a new record among hoopers! At 124.5 mm, the Giannis Immortality 4 has the widest midsole in the forefoot we've seen so far in our lab. This means our feet had a spacious platform to step on, and even the most aggressive jumps (like when you hit someone mid-air getting a rebound) found happy landings. Test results Giannis Immortality 4 124.5 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The heel didn't get to break any records, but it's still way wider than average. At 97.3 mm, it's a whole 7% wider than the typical result for basketball shoes. This offered us plenty of room to stabilize ourselves after landing. Test results Giannis Immortality 4 97.3 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability We did expect an average durability after our breathability test, and turns out we were just right! Your browser does not support the video tag. We always put our Dremel on the same spot and, this time, it didn't catch the rubberized protection the Giannis Immortality 4 has surrounding the toe area. At 5K RPM and with 3.2N of force, the tool left the material messed up, but nothing too bad. As the Dremel couldn't break the upper completely, we decided to give this Nike pair a 3/5 on our toebox durability test. Test results Giannis Immortality 4 3 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability We were pretty happy with the results this shoe had shown us so far, but when we started our heel padding durability test, we couldn't keep our mouths closed! Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see, our Dremel test wasn't more than a tickling game for the Giannis Immortality 4. Its heel showed us its nerves of steel ending up unharmed. With such a clean result, how could we ever give it any less than a 5/5? Test results Giannis Immortality 4 5 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness Our durometer returned 86.1 HC when we measured this Nike's outsole hardness. This result is higher than average, indicating the rubber might focus on being durable, and not so much on being grippy. But in RunRepeat we don't just make assumptions, we test the shoes to their bones! Test results Giannis Immortality 4 86.1 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability So, to see if the outsole hardness matched its durability, we grabbed our Dremel once again. Your browser does not support the video tag. The tool drilled the rubber at 10K RPM this time, but with the same 3.2N of force. We could see white dust flying all over our lab, which is bad news! Yep, we were right. Our tread gauge measured the dent at 1.5 mm, which is a scary 33% deeper than average. This means this Nike's outsole is not on the durable side. Consequently, we would advise you to check our streetball pairs if you want to play outdoors and leave the Giannis Immortality 4 for your indoor games. Test results Giannis Immortality 4 1.5 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness Despite the lack of durability of its rubber, it's not like this Nike has a very thick outsole. Our caliper returned 4.0 mm, which is just average. So, even if after our warnings you still want to wear this hooper to play ball outdoors on harsh courts, please keep in mind that its outsole will wear out way sooner than expected. Test results Giannis Immortality 4 4.0 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness Nike decided to go for a standard insole in this shoe. At 4.4 mm, there's nothing special to say about it. It does its bit to the overall comfort of the Giannis Immortality 4, and that's it. Test results Giannis Immortality 4 4.4 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole The Giannis Immortality 4 has a removable insole. This means that you can change it (if you want or need to) and use your own orthotics. Test results Giannis Immortality 4 Yes Reflective elements There are no reflective elements in this economic hooper, exactly as we expected and hand in hand with the previous iterations. Test results Giannis Immortality 4 No Tongue padding We were pleasantly surprised to discover the smart placing of the padding in the overall design of this Nike pair. Regarding the tongue, our caliper returned 8.2 mm. As you can see in the picture, it's all located at the top, which is where we tie the laces. This prevented any lace bite, which is always great news. Even though the Giannis Immortality 4 doesn't feature that extra eyelet at the top that we love, its extended heel and padded collar offer enough support to make up for it. Test results Giannis Immortality 4 8.2 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type To level up even more an already high foot containment, the Giannis Immortality 4 comes in with a semi-gusseted tongue on both sides. Come on, who'd believe this is a budget shoe? Test results Giannis Immortality 4 Both sides (semi) Price The Giannis Immortality line focuses on being affordable. Its low-cost self keeps the same design version after version, adding minor upgrades. Taking into account all the advantages we've found this shoe offers, we can confidently say it offers wonderful value for money. Test results Giannis Immortality 4 $85 Average $135 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes $70 Price $210 Heel tab This hooper doesn't have any kind of finger loop, but it features a very practical extended heel. It helps to put on the shoe, and it also offers great support in the Achilles area.

This new iteration features a durable bootie construction that hugged our feet comfortably in every game we played. Its foot containment is just otherworldly, and its supportive structure helped us land confidently after rebounding. The best part of this is that its Jet Boost foam pushed us back up thanks to its bounce, keeping our feet comfortable due to fantastic shock-absorbing properties. Overall, the Adidas Harden Volume 8 is a smooth shoe that moved easily alongside our feet during our wear tests, but we didn't find it fast enough for players with quick footwork. Top pick in best basketball shoes (2024) Pros Excellent foot containment Crazy good traction Fantastic shock-absorption and bounce Feels very stable Incredibly comfortable from minute 1 Supportive heel area Smooth heel-to-toe transitions Very easy to put on and off Cons Not a fast shoe Not for wide feet Not for streetball Audience verdict 90 Great!

Fantastic shock absorption for every landing and a bouncy midsole to push you back up right away. Great traction and stability to post-play confidently. Who should NOT buy We could talk about the controversial design of the Harden Volume 8 here, but we're gonna leave that to the fashionistas. Focusing on function rather than form, we can say this shoe is not the best to play outdoors. If you're a toe-dragger, just like us, its structure will suffer quite a lot. It might work for a while, that's for sure, but if you want to play ball on outdoor courts for a while, we believe you should have a look at our streetball shoes catalog . Your browser does not support the video tag. The hoopers among us whose playstyle relies on quick footwork found this Adidas pair a little bit too heavy for that. If you want something affordable, the Giannis Immortality 3 might be worth checking out. If you don't mind paying a bit more, the UA Curry 11 felt really nimble when we tried it on! Cushioning Heel stack Here in RunRepeat, we always cut shoes in half. Why? Well, because we need to have access to every single piece we want to assess and analyze! Some of them are hidden inside the shoe, and if you don't cut it down, there's no way you'll fully know them! At 28.2 mm, our caliper indicated the Harden Vol 8 is almost as tall as the average in the heel. We don't want to spoil anything, but let us tell you that we really, really loved this shoe's cushioning! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Harden Vol. 8 28.2 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack The forefoot stack follows the same path, being slightly lower than average according to our caliper. At 20.6 mm, we can't say this model will isolate you from the harshness of the court. And we can't say that it'll let you feel every little detail you step on. But as its forefoot is quite low, we gained control over our moves. We felt really stable and close to the surface, and at the same time, its cushioning provided us with wonderful shock absorption every time we jumped! Your browser does not support the video tag. We'll talk later on about this shoe's midsole, its foam, and how it felt when we played some games during our wear tests. Test results Harden Vol. 8 20.6 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop At 7.6 mm, the Harden Vol 8's drop is just average. There's not a crazy difference between the heel and the forefoot stacks (as in too much or too little), so our feet didn't have to get used to any kind of design. Now that we have a clear view of this Adidas, as we cut in half every shoe that comes to our lab, we'll tell you a little bit more about its interiors. As you can see, its upper is only padded in some key areas, and it doesn't feature very stretchy material. Your browser does not support the video tag. It also includes a double heel counter that provided great hold in that area (we'll talk about this later on) during our wear tests. Nevertheless, we can't see any technologies in the midsole. Just a plastic shank at the bottom (black) that offered some support to our strides. Test results Harden Vol. 8 7.6 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. When we measured the midsole softness of the Vol 8, our durometer returned 15.5 HA. This is a really soft score, which just confirms what our feet felt during our playtests: this shoe's foam is like a cloud. But not like a mushy cloud, more like a bouncy one! Your browser does not support the video tag. Going up and down the court in this shoe felt wonderful, as our feet could enjoy the incredible shock absorption and spring of its full-length JETBOOST foam. Your browser does not support the video tag. We felt really comfortable, and the energy provided by this Adidas' midsole helped us bounce back (no pun intended) in every move, like Euro steps for example. The best part is that, thanks to the shank this shoe has at the bottom, we felt really stable despite the softness of the material. Test results Harden Vol. 8 15.5 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Adidas Harden Vol. 8 fits true to size (119 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Toebox width - widest part Our caliper had to open wide to measure this shoe's toebox width at the widest part! At 113.2 mm, our feet were pretty happy with all the space they had! This sounds like a dream for wide-foot hoopers, doesn't it? Well... pro tip: don't celebrate too early. This shoe follows methodology 1.8. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Harden Vol. 8 113.2 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width - big toe Before you start recommending this shoe to your pals with wide feet, check the measure of its toebox width at the big toe... you might change your mind. At the incredible figure of 78.1 mm, this Adidas pair tapers like crazy, losing 7 mm of width in comparison with its predecessor! Our standard-sized feet enjoyed the Harden Vol 8, but we can see wide-toed hoopers having a hard time with it. Additionally, the protection that it has in the toebox is not stretchy at all, so it's better if you don't expect it to give in after a couple of games! This shoe follows methodology 1.8. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Harden Vol. 8 78.1 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Flexibility / Stiffness Our lab results confirmed the flexibility we felt during our wear tests with this Adidas pair. Your browser does not support the video tag. At 31.5N, we needed less force than average to make it bend all the way up to 90 degrees. In our feet, this translated into smoother transitions and easier fakes and pivoting. Your browser does not support the video tag. We were really happy about it, as it mean the Hardel Vol 8 combines a wonderful lockdown feel with a more pliable structure that wasn't rough with our feet. Even though the shoe needs to warm up a bit before it can unleash its full potential, we enjoyed our time with it from the very first minute we put it on (which, by the way, is a piece of cake!). Your browser does not support the video tag. This shoe follows methodology 1.8. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below.

Yep, forget about feeling quick and nimble when you run up and down the court with them! At 15.9 oz/451.0g, the Adidas Harden Vol 8 is lighter than its predecessor . And that's it! It felt bottom-heavy to us, and we believe it might be more suitable for centers and players who post-play a lot. Your browser does not support the video tag. Before we move on to the next section, let us state that this pair is a whole 13% heavier than the average of its category. Test results Harden Vol. 8 15.9 oz (451g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability We could easily summarize our experience in the ventilation department of the Harden Vol 8 with just two words: unexpectedly breathable! Your browser does not support the video tag. Even though the light doesn't go through a single pore of this Adidas pair, we didn't feel our feet were horribly suffocating during our wear tests. To know more about its breathability levels, we grabbed our smoke machine and started the party. Your browser does not support the video tag. Just look at that! There's a quick, constant, and thick smoke column coming from right under the toe area. We can't say this pair is an equal rival to the Curry 10 . But its battle against the Book 1 ? An easy victory! Its bootie construction features a textile upper with big holes. Nevertheless, the structure includes multiple layers that restrict smooth airflow. In conclusion, we've decided to give the Harden Vol 8 a solid 4/5 on our breathability test. It's a really good score in our basketball shoes category! Test results Harden Vol. 8 4 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test This shoe's structure offers great containment. The EVA walls it has on the sides (check the picture below) and the bootie structure hugged our feet nicely during our wear tests playing ball. But even though its foot containment is wonderful, its lateral stability is not as good as what a shoe with a regular firm construction might offer. Your browser does not support the video tag. Things would be totally different if the EVA pieces participated in the lacing system, of course. Still, we felt safe in the shoe and we enjoyed its overall stability. As a tip, we would recommend lacing it all up to the top, without skipping the last eyelet. Torsional rigidity As we had already hinted, this Adidas pair doesn't have the most rigid structure. Your browser does not support the video tag. The EVA sides and pretty much the whole shoe bent alongside our fingers and feet. Even though this meant less lateral support, it also translated into smoother and quicker moves on the court, skipping any kind of painful or harsh break-in period (yes, LeBron 21 , we're looking right at you!). Your browser does not support the video tag. We did not find the Harden Vol 8 unstable at all. Its bootie construction, extra thick heel counter, and long shank made sure we were safe. All in all, we enjoyed wonderful stability underfoot and enough pliability to perform fake shots from minute 1. Test results Harden Vol. 8 3 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness The shoe's heel counter has a good deal of structure and stiffness thanks to the EVA exoskeleton. Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see, the EVA pieces of the sides follow our fingers' orders easily. The top of the bootie construction is pretty much the same, bowing without much resistance. But when we get to the middle part of the heel, the structure becomes way more stiff. That is exactly what holds our feet in place! The double heel counter offered excellent foot containment. And even though its exaggerated structure might not be everyone's cup of tea, its solid hold on the Achilles tendon is undeniable. Test results Harden Vol. 8 4 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot When we measured the midsole width in the forefoot, our caliper returned 114.3 mm. This is a standard width, and even though the Harden Vol 8 might seem like a buffed-up hooper if you look at its pictures online, its fit is the complete opposite. Test results Harden Vol. 8 114.3 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The midsole width in the heel is also average, at 90.3 mm. This shoe's base is not incredibly wide, and its sole doesn't feature any flares to enhance it. Nevertheless, we didn't feel unstable in our landings. The Harden Volume 8 offers just the right surface to land steadily, no more and no less. Test results Harden Vol. 8 90.3 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability Once we saw this shoe's rubber protection in the toebox, we knew our Dremel wouldn't be having fun this time. Your browser does not support the video tag. After 12 seconds of constant drill at 5K RPM and 3.2N of force, this Adidas pair showed its wonderful skills as a defender! The result was wonderful, and we felt pretty satisfied. We mean, you don't always get to see such a breathable and durable hooper! Just look at that, the poor Nike Precision 6 (right) had such a hard time that we couldn't give it any more than a 1/5 on our toebox durability test. On the other hand, the Adidas Harden Volume 8 has earned a solid and well-deserved 4/5 on this same test! Test results Harden Vol. 8 4 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability Our Dremel's second battle was about to start, and right after the first second, we already knew who'd be the winner! Your browser does not support the video tag. The tool didn't make a fuss, and it didn't really mess up the material of the heel. So we decided to give it a fantastic 4/5 on our heel padding durability test. We can't say this Adidas model actually has padding in that area, as it features a bootie construction. Nevertheless, we didn't change our Dremel's adjustments and parameters, which means the Harden Vol 8 passed the test successfully, just like any other shoe. If you want to see what failing our heel padding durability test looks like, check the Reebok Answer DMX (right) and it's messed up material! Test results Harden Vol. 8 4 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness Our durometer returned 75.9 HC when we measured the Harden Vol 8's outsole hardness. This result is lower than average, and even though it still indicates this shoe offers a healthy mix of durability and traction... it might lean towards the latter. Test results Harden Vol. 8 75.9 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability The outsole of this shoe is so nice that it deserves its own part. And it will get it, you just need to go down to the Traction section in this review. But for now, we're going to check its durability using our Dremel one last time. Your browser does not support the video tag. The test lasted 22 seconds, and the tool was at 10K RPM and with 3.2N of force. Once we finished, we measured the dent left with our tread gauge, which returned 1.0 mm. A nice result once again! We might be right in the durable + grippy hypothesis. Stay tuned to find that out! Test results Harden Vol. 8 1.0 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness At 3.0 mm, this shoe's outsole is pretty thin. Actually, the average is a solid 27% thicker, which is a lot. This is one of the reasons why we believe the Vol 8 is not the best shoe to play streetball. It doesn't have the strongest rubber on its outsole, and the layer of material is not thick enough to withstand the constant abrasion of harsh courts. Test results Harden Vol. 8 3.0 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness At 4.1 mm, the Harden Vol 8's insole is just average.

Test results Harden Vol. 8 4.1 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole The Harden Vol 8 features a standard insole, but what we love the most is that it's removable! Even though its style is as clean as a summer morning, you might want something more supportive or to use your own orthotics. Test results Harden Vol. 8 Yes Reflective elements This newer model doesn't include any reflective elements in its design. We checked it in our lab! Test results Harden Vol. 8 No Tongue padding This shoe doesn't really have a tongue! Its bootie construction surrounds the foot, hugging it tightly from every angle. So the upper is just one piece! Still, we put our caliper in the area that embraces the instep and it returned 6.1 mm. Even though this Adidas pair keeps it low-key, we found the material thick enough to protect our foot from the laces comfortably. By the way, if you look right next to the tongue, you'll see the inner eyelets of the shoe. This levels up even more the overall containment, as it pulls the structure from the inside all the way to the outside! Test results Harden Vol. 8 6.1 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type The upper of this shoe hugged our feet comfortably. It works as a one-piece structure that offers a close fit to every hooper. So we can't talk about a gusseted or non-gusseted tongue here, as the Harden Vol 8 features a sock-like design. The EVA parts that surround and protect it are held together by the white rubberized piece at the front. That last part is pretty resistant, yet we believe the EVA sides don't offer as much protection as we'd like to play streetball. Especially if you're a toe-dragger like us!

Test results Harden Vol. 8 Sock like Heel tab We believe the finger-loop was a must in the Harden Vol 8, as it makes its bootie construction way easier to put on!

As a lightened version of the LeBron 20 , it fuses LeBron's famous impact protection with an excellent ground feel which results in more solid control over footwork. We highly recommend getting this shoe if you plan to get aggressive on the court.

Wide footers are going to be better off with the Nike LeBron Witness 7 instead. Your browser does not support the video tag. Even though it is a step-down version of the Lebron 20 and is $40 cheaper, it still remains among the priciest options on the market. If price is a deal-breaker for you, check out Kevin Durant's signature shoe, the KD 15 . Cushioning Shock absorption New The LeBron NXXT GEN's inner workings look nearly identical to those of the flagship LeBron 20 shoe. But there are more subtle differences that affect the shoe's performance. Our shock absorption tests showed that the NXXT GEN offers less impact protection than its more advanced counterpart. While the shoe's below-average measurements of 93 SA in the heel and 81 SA in the forefoot offer a decent buffer from hard landings, it feels notably more grounded and less cushioned. Heel Forefoot Test results Lebron NXXT GEN 93 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New Luckily, the shoe's Zoom Turbo and Zoom Air units still do their job effectively and keep the NXXT GEN's ride springy and dynamic. The shoe's rebound proved to be on par with the more expensive LeBrons, with an above-average energy return of 66.3% in the heel and 63.2% in the forefoot. Heel Forefoot Test results Lebron NXXT GEN 63.2% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack The amount of cushioning in the NXXT GEN is exactly the same as in the Lebron 20. Using a caliper, we measured its heel stack height at 26.9 mm. Test results Lebron NXXT GEN 26.9 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack Measuring the forefoot stack height, we found its thickness to be the same 22 mm as in the Lebron 20. The large Zoom Turbo unit is still there, adding a sweet bounce to every jump. Test results Lebron NXXT GEN 22.0 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop The heel-to-toe differential in the Lebron NXXT GEN turns out to be 4.9 mm. This is lower than the average 7 mm of our lab-tested basketball shoes. Placing the foot more parallel to the ground results in a more grounded experience. We are happy with the fine balance of cushioning and ground feel that the NXXT provides. It follows in the footsteps of the Lebron 20 in that regard. As you can see from the photo below, the cushioning setups are pretty much identical in these two shoes. Nike Lebron 20 Test results Lebron NXXT GEN 4.9 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. While those Zoom Air units do an amazing job of adding spring to the feet, the carrying foam remains on the firm side. Based on our durometer, the foam has a thickness of 30.6 HA. This is 10% firmer than the average. But we aren't here to complain about that! This is what makes the shoe so grounded and stable. We actually think that this is one of the best setups for balancing impact protection and court feel. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Lebron NXXT GEN 30.6 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Nike Lebron NXXT GEN fits true to size (136 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit At 98.9 mm in the widest part of the toebox, the shoe turns out to be a little narrower than average. For our medium-width feet, the NXXT GEN feels rather snug and precise. There is not much breathing room so if you need more space, it's better to go half-size up. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Lebron NXXT GEN 98.9 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width This LeBron shoe also tapers a bit more than the other basketball shoes we've measured. With a width of 74.9 mm around the big toe, the NXXT GEN is narrower than the average by a few millimeters. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Lebron NXXT GEN 74.9 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New Sliding the shoe's forefoot against a professional court surface, our machine recorded a solid friction score of 0.70. You can expect consistent grip from this Nike LeBron shoe, but it won't be as tacky and top-pier as in the flagship Nike LeBron 22 (0.95). Test results Lebron NXXT GEN 0.70 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New The shoe features a full-length translucent rubber with a very dense tread pattern. Cute fact: The pattern replicates the map of Akron, OH which is a nod to LeBron James' roots. Flexibility / Stiffness New The Nike Lebron NXXT GEN finds a way to be flexible despite the large Zoom unit embedded into its forefoot. Using a gauge to measure how much force it takes to bend the shoe by 30 degrees, we got a pretty low reading of 15.4N. It is less than it takes an average hoop shoe, especially if it carries LeBron's name, and translates into a pretty natural and maneuverable underfoot experience. However, bigger players may find it too forgiving and lacking support for their explosive moves and post-play. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Lebron NXXT GEN 15.4N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight LeBron basketball shoes have earned a reputation for being heavy. But the Nike LeBron NXXT GEN breaks away from that. At 13.1 oz (372 g), it is a lot lighter than the average for LeBron shoes (14.3 oz or 406g). It also turns out to be lighter than our lab-tested hoop shoes on average (13.7 oz or 387g). Test results Lebron NXXT GEN 13.1 oz (372g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability The NXXT GEN is a toasty one. With its sturdy upper materials, the shoe doesn't allow heat to escape from the interiors. Having pumped smoke through its upper, we saw only a little streak coming out on the other side. Thus, the shoe gets as little as 2 out of 5 for breathability. Your browser does not support the video tag. Looking at the upper material through our microscope, there is not even a slight hint of perforations. From the inside, the upper is also reinforced with foam padding and neoprene-ish lining, leaving no \"breathing room\" either. There is a small ventilation spot on the inner side of the upper though. It can be seen in our transparency test below. This little window is not covered by the in-shoe padding allowing mesh to do its job. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Lebron NXXT GEN 2 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test For a s compared to the original Lebron 20, it retains a solid level of support and stability. From the stiff shank in the midfoot to the firm hold of the upper materials, our feet felt safely contained inside the NXXT GEN. Torsional rigidity The stiff midfoot shank is very helpful in stabilizing the foot for agile multi-directional movements. Having twisted the shoe sideways in our manual test, we rated its torsional rigidity as 4 out of 5. Nearly the stiffest in our range! Test results Lebron NXXT GEN 4 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness Our heels and ankles felt securely contained inside the NXXT GEN. On a 1-5 scale where 5 is the stiffest, we rated its heel counter stiffness as 3. This is a little less rigid than the average but solid enough for a proper hold. Test results Lebron NXXT GEN 3 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot The NXXT GEN doesn't have as wide an outrigger as the Lebron 20. Measuring the widest part of the forefoot with a caliper (107.9 mm), we found that it is a few millimeters narrower than the original. But in our opinion, this is a rather small sacrifice to make if you want to experience the lightest Lebron shoe in the series. It is in no way detrimental to the shoe's stability. Test results Lebron NXXT GEN 107.9 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel To reassure you of the shoe's ample stability, the widest part of its heel (90.3 mm) is still the same as the average. Test results Lebron NXXT GEN 90.3 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability The shoe's upper material has an average level of durability for a basketball shoe. After a 12-second encounter with our Dremel at the speed of 10K RPM, the shoe's toebox got only moderately damaged. We didn't get to a see-through hole and the shoe remained wearable. Your browser does not support the video tag. For that reason, we rated its toebox durability as 3 on a scale from 1 to 5. It is certainly not as sturdy as the Lebron 20 but it has more abrasion resistance than the cheaper Lebron Witness 7 . Nike Lebron NXXT GEN vs. Nike Lebron Witness 7 You can also see a suede piece embracing the toebox upfront. That really helps to protect the upper mesh from the aggressive toe drags. Test results Lebron NXXT GEN 3 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability The heel padding of the NXXT GEN also showed off its wear resistance. This delicate part of the shoe performed a little better than most hoop shoes in our lab. After 4 seconds of drilling it with a Dremel, the tear was not detrimental to the shoe's overall performance and comfort, earning a rating of 3 out of 5. Test results Lebron NXXT GEN 3 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness Assessing the shoe's rubber outsole, we found its durability to be quite promising too. First, we pressed a durometer against the rubber to measure its hardness. With a reading of 84.5 HC, it turns out to be harder than average. That translates to a higher chance of longer shelf life. Test results Lebron NXXT GEN 84.5 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole thickness Measuring the shoe's outsole with a caliper, we found it to be of average thickness at 3.8 mm. Combined with the hardness, this gives us a solid base for hundreds of hours on the court. We can even recommend the shoe for occasional outdoor use for that reason. Test results Lebron NXXT GEN 3.8 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness A padded insole complements the shoe's primary cushioning. Measuring it with a caliper, we found that at 3.6 mm it is a little thinner than average. Test results Lebron NXXT GEN 3.6 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole For those who need to use custom orthotics with the shoe, the NXXT GEN has a removable insole. Test results Lebron NXXT GEN Yes Tongue padding The tongue is very generously padded in the NXXT GEN shoe. We measured its thickness at 10.2 mm. It offers plenty of in-shoe comfort and guards the instep from lace pressure. Test results Lebron NXXT GEN 10.2 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type A fully-gusseted tongue really enhances the lockdown capacities of this shoe. There was no sliding of the foot or the tongue even during the most shifty situations on the court.

This pair's great success has been demonstrated by our lab and wear tests, as it constantly got fantastic scores and showed its wonderful performance. Its 1-to-1 fit and supportive structure work hand in hand with its natural flexibility, giving us the confidence we needed to perform in-n-out and many other explosive moves. As it's also pretty lightweight, we felt fast with it, which we believe is ideal for quick guards and forwards that shine because of their speedy footwork. Its close-to-the-ground structure and cushioning technologies gave us the best of both worlds, levelling up this shoe's efficiency to the max. But it's a Nike model after all, so we wouldn't recommend it to wide-foot hoopers. Overall, we couldn't be happier with this first release. Top pick in best basketball shoes for women Pros Excellent overall performance and playability Very durable and quality materials Nice shock-absorption and midsole technologies Great forefoot bounce Supportive structure and great lockdown Fantastic flexibility and court feel Solid grip on different surfaces Beloved Kobe-like aesthetics Customizable Cons Not for outdoors Not for wide feet A bit pricier than other first releases Audience verdict 86 Good!

You should definitely check the Sabrina 1 out if you're looking for: A top performer on indoor courts. A model that gives you a lot of ground feel and reliable cushioning technologies. A Nike pair that offers a wonderful lockdown feel and containment. A light and flexible hooper for quick and explosive moves and footwork. A customisable and fashionable ball pal. Who should not buy Even though this model's solid grip and lateral reinforcements might make it seem like it's ready to play some streetball, we definitely wouldn't recommend it. Its outsole is not the toughest one out there, so it'll wear out pretty soon. If you want to play outdoors, you should have a look at our catalog of shoes that can deal with the abrasion of those surfaces . Your browser does not support the video tag. If you're a wide-foot hooper and you like spacious shoes, you should definitely skip these Nikes. The Adidas Harden Stepback 3 is a bit weighty, but it's a model designed for guards and for centres that adapts to big-toed bballers. It's also more affordable than the Sabrina 1! Cushioning Heel stack Once we cut the shoe open, we grabbed our caliper and put it in the heel to measure its stack. At 23.7 mm, it's lower than average. This might make you think that this model lacks shock absorption, but it doesn't! We'll talk more about it when we analise its midsole, please wait patiently. We felt pretty close to the court with this shoe during our wear tests. This improved the control we had over our moves, giving us a confidence boost. Consequently, we went for more daring moves, like more difficult dribbles or risky steps in our 1vs1. Test results Sabrina 1 23.7 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack Our caliper told us that this shoe's stack height is even lower in the forefoot! It's the lowest forefoot stack we've seen so far in our lab! At 18.0 mm, it even got a lower score than the Adidas Harden Vol. 7 , the Nike G.T. Hustle 2 , and the Nike Cosmic Unity 2 (the three of them scored 18.2 mm). Pretty impressive! When we played with the Sabrina 1, this translated into a wonderful court feel. We could go for effective fakes and crossover steps, we really enjoyed the performance of these Nikes! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Sabrina 1 18.0 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop Both stack heights are low, and this left us with an also low drop of 5.7 mm. We are going to use this picture of the Sabrina 1 cut in half to talk about the wonderful technologies we found in its midsole: First of all, these Nikes have a full-length React foam that combines TPE and EVA. On the forefoot, there's a really thin Zoom Unit. But don't let its size trick you, it still felt amazing underfoot, propelling us back up every time we stepped aggressively on it. The black line you can see in the midfoot is a shank that gives some fantastic support. We actually believe this design works fantastically well with the shock-absorbing midsole. We felt safe and surefooted in our playtests. Test results Sabrina 1 5.7 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. Do you remember what we were saying about the shank being a perfect match for the Sabrina 1's midsole? Our durometer explained why with just a number. At 19.0 HA, it's definitely on the softer side. That's why the shank is a perfect match for it, as it gives this pair the stability it needs to perform incredibly well on the court and get the best of both worlds: plusness and support! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Sabrina 1 19.0 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Nike Sabrina 1 fits slightly small (116 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit When our caliper returned 106.8 mm, we could only nod. This model's toebox width at the widest part is over 5 mm wider than average, which is wonderful news for stability and comfort. But hey, let's not go crazy about how spacious this sounds. This is a Nike shoe after all, remember? This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Sabrina 1 106.8 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width Yeah, even if any of us didn't remember, our feet sure did. As per usual, these Nikes get incredibly narrower towards the big toe. You can see it clearly in the pictures, this model tappers aggressively and it might be more suitable for standard-sized feet players like us, or users with narrow feet. The Sabrina 1's containment is pretty solid, which means that even if your feet are a bit more on the narrow side it should still give you the support you need. Consequently, we definitely cannot recommend this model to wide feet ballers. It'd definitely cramp their toes, which wouldn't only affect their performance negatively, but also their health. On our standard-width feet, this shoe's fit was great. No complaints at all! This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Sabrina 1 75.9 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Flexibility / Stiffness The Sabrina 1 has been surprising us time and time again. This shoe didn't get tired of getting wonderful scores on our tests, and we didn't get tired of verifying it! Your browser does not support the video tag. When we performed of flex test and we saw the result was 30.4 N, we couldn't be happier. It's true that, on the one hand, we did expect this score because of what our feet felt during our wear tests. The Sabrina 1 bent comfortably at the ball of the foot, going along with our moves smoothly. We found this ideal for shooting, fakes, and open and cross steps. Can you think of one thing that these moves have in common? Exactly, the constant bending of the ball of the foot. Every shoe is going to let you make those moves, as they are typical in this sport. Yet some will make them smoother than others, that's for sure! The Sabrina 1 is pretty flexible, and our feet could tell. This made us have better control of any kind of fake we went for, as the forefoot bent easily. This is great for opening drills, as you need to pivot constantly if you're trying to trick your opponent. This equals your shoe bending back and forth in that same area, and the more flexible it is, the easier it will be for you to explosively perform the move.

Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Sabrina 1 30.4N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight One more fantastic result is on the way! Let's go with the numbers first and with our feet later. When we saw 12.5 oz/353.0g on our scale, we were really happy. It's a solid 11% lighter than average, which is wonderful for a model with such durable materials! Your browser does not support the video tag. And it was the same feeling for our feet, too! This shoe's performance is unbeatable, and we felt super light dribbling, and during cuts and layups. It didn't stop us at all, and it really felt like an extension of our own foot. We believe quick guards are going to love the Sabrina 1 as much as we do! Test results Sabrina 1 12.5 oz (353g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability Finding a breathable basketball shoe nowadays is not an easy task! To check if a model is well-ventilated or not, we perform a couple of tests, starting with our beloved smoke machine. Your browser does not support the video tag. We were off to a slow start! We patiently sat looking at the shoe, just thinking: \"Where did all the smoke go?\". After some seconds the shoe finally started breathing, it felt just like putting your shoe underwater and finally going up to take a deep breath! On the one hand, the Under Armour Curry 10 showed a wonderful performance in our breathability test. That's what a 5/5 in ventilation looks like! On the other hand, it took the Sabrina 1 a while, but it managed to let out some smoke, earning a 2/5. Let's see if our light gives us some more hints! Your browser does not support the video tag. Bingo! We could see some light trying to get through the mesh, so of course its breathability would be slightly better than some other models that have thicker upper materials. Our microscope showed us how tightly woven the toebox material of this shoe is. There's no way the air would have it easy with such a barrier between out feet and the outside world! Test results Sabrina 1 2 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test From the very first moment we saw this shoe, we just couldn't wait to put it on. On our lateral stability test, we lace each pair all the way up and start wobbling our ankles. We were actually pretty happy with this shoe's containment, look at the video below and you'll see why! Your browser does not support the video tag. During our wear tests, we enjoyed this shoe's supportive structure. It didn't feel rigid or too constraining, it was just like a safe elongation of our own foot. That's how it felt! We could perform in-n-out moves like backdoor cuts. These types of moves can be done slowly, that's for sure, but the slower you go for it, the more effectiveness it loses. In mid to high-level basketball, you'll definitely see players go for explosive backdoor cuts. It's a very common move among forwards! But feeling unstable will make you want to avoid it, which would totally be a shame. Your browser does not support the video tag. See? The Sabrina 1 is total and completely ready not only to face the challenge, but also to excel at it! Torsional rigidity Basketball shoes tend to be very rigid. This is usually because of their tough and durable materials, that act like a shield for your feet to avoid injuries. Your browser does not support the video tag. Performing our torsional rigidity test on the Sabrina 1. It scored an agreeable 3/5. As you can see in the video, it was not hard for us to bend this model at all! If you wanna see what our struggling thumbs look like, let us show you the video from when we tried to bend the LeBron 21. OH. MY. GOSH. Your browser does not support the video tag. Performing our torsional rigidity test on the Nike LeBron 21 . It scored a stubborn 5/5. We actually loved this big change. It was like a breath of fresh air regarding the typical structure that the latest basketball shoes have gone for: extra rigid. This allowed us to perform every single move more comfortably and, on top of that, more precisely! The Sabrina 1's structure is more bendy, yet it's such a grounded shoe that we never felt unstable. We think this design idea works wonders for quick and agile players, as that's how this pair itself made us feel. Test results Sabrina 1 3 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness To add some extra points to the overall stability of this model, we have its heel counter. Your browser does not support the video tag. It scored a fantastic 4/5 on our stiffness test, which is slightly higher than average. Its well-structured self added to the amount of padding this shoe has on that area is the perfect combination for a wonderful lockdown feel. Have a look at this shoe's interior after we cut it in half and then separated its upper. The amount of padding it has is what enhances the lockdown feel and surefootedness, especially in the heel area. And we love it! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Sabrina 1 4 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot More and more stability is on the way! At 116.3 mm, our caliper indicated that this shoe's midsole width in the forefoot is a couple millimeters wider than average. This means so extra room for your feet to land comfortably after jumping! Test results Sabrina 1 116.3 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel At 89.7 mm, this shoe's heel width is pretty much average. But this also didn't affect our stability. The fit is snug and it has a lot of padding, so our feet felt this model's welcoming hug at the back as soon as we put it on. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Sabrina 1 89.7 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability When we first saw this shoe (and its incredibly cool box, by the way), we couldn't keep our mouths closed. It looks awesome! But it's more than a pretty face, and our Dremel was absolutely ready to prove it. Your browser does not support the video tag. What's that again? Nothing, you say? Yeah, nothing at all! Our tool lost this battle, just look at these pictures. We can't say the results of this durability test were more than an aesthetically unpleasing scratch. It didn't affect the shoe's functionality or integrity at all, which is wonderful news. We gave the Sabrina 1 a well-deserved 5/5 in our toebox durability test. If you want to see how hard it is to get such score, let us show you what the Nike Precision 6 looked like after this same test. That's a 1/5 score in our toebox durability test for you! Test results Sabrina 1 5 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability We were also pretty happy with the results of this next test! Moving our Dremel to the back of the shoe, we went all in and attacked its heel padding. Your browser does not support the video tag. Once again, it looks like our tool is struggling! The damage was minimal, so we gave the Sabrina 1 a 4/5 on our heel padding durability test. Not bad at all! It has once again outperformed many other models, as this is a quite vulnerable spot for shoes. Just compare these Nikes' results with the Reebok Answer DMX 's. The difference is quite big, isn't it? Look at all that messed-up white material! This Reebok basketball shoe scored a 1/5 in our heel padding durability test. We just couldn't give it anything higher! Test results Sabrina 1 4 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness At 86.5 HC, our durometer indicated this shoe's outsole is slightly harder than the standard. It's quite a promising start, as this indicates the outsole should be more durable than average. Let's see if our Dremel agrees! Test results Sabrina 1 86.5 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability We were ready for action, as always! So we grabbed our Dremel and started digging in the Sabrina 1's outsole. Let's get this party started! Your browser does not support the video tag. After our 22-second-long test at 10K RPM and 3.2N, our tread gauge confirmed our Dremel left a dent of 0.9 mm. This is an average score for basketball shoes, so not bad! We put the tool in the same spot in every shoe. This time, as you can see in the picture, the rolling piece went for the black section, but it also included the lighter part in its attack. We were pretty happy with the result, as this model has a kind of spiky herringbone pattern, so the tool didn't actually make it to the base of the outsole. We also find this outsole pretty reliable during our wear tests, even outdoors! But if you use the Sabrina 1 to play streetball, please keep in mind it will not last long. It doesn't have the most resistant outsole out there, even if its performance is great. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Sabrina 1 0.9 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness When our caliper returned 4.1 mm, we realised these Nikes' outsole was as thick as the average. Once again, this result tells us that the Sabrina 1 is not the best shoe to play outdoors. Its outsole is neither the thickest nor the most resistant to abrasion, so outdoor courts will definitely take a toll on it every time you play. Test results Sabrina 1 4.1 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness Its insole is just as thick as the average. At 4.5 mm, we don't have anything different to say here. The insole didn't have to compensate for any kind of lack from the midsole, and its not overly thick nature helps the shoe keep some oz/g out of the way! Test results Sabrina 1 4.5 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole To be honest, we were pretty happy with this model's standard insole. Still, if you need to use your own orthotics or if you simply want to change it, no worries: it's removable! Test results Sabrina 1 Yes Reflective elements No reflective elements around, but it's not like the Sabrina 1 needed them anyway! As we said before, we believe it's better to keep this shoe for indoor courts, as its outsole would definitely wear out sooner than expected if it has to face the abrasion of streetball surfaces. In other words, you don't need your shoes to have reflective as in indoor courts there's always some kind of light. Test results Sabrina 1 No Tongue padding At 11.0 mm, this shoe's tongue is pretty padded. Following the foot containment we mentioned in our previous test, our caliper indicated that the padding of the tongue adds some extra surefootedness. Additionally, as the top is the most padded part, it protects us from any kind of lace bite. This shoe felt like an extension of our own feet during our wear tests, and the fact that we could tie the laces strongly and pull to feel safer thanks to the tongue's padding was a wonderful detail. We believe this matches perfectly the Sabrina 1's fit and lockdown feel. Test results Sabrina 1 11.0 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type Lockdown feel and containment are two of the key points this model can brag about. Its general structure definitely reinforces both these areas, but the cherry on top is the Sabrina 1's tongue. Being fully gusseted, this piece made sure our feet didn't move from their right place. We really enjoyed this feature, as it gave us some extra confidence during our playtests. Additionally, the locked-in feel is one of the strong points of the Sabrina 1, which felt like a tailor-made shoe. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Sabrina 1 Both sides (full) Heel tab These Nikes don't have any kind of heel tab at the back. Instead, it has a solid design with the signature of Sabrina Ionescu and the protagonist. We loved the minimal yet cool aura this detail embodied, matching the shoe's vibe perfectly. With a fully gusseted tongue and a locked-in focused structure, putting on and taking off this pair was not the easiest task out there. But we didn't really mind it, though. We just had to make sure the laces were comfortably separated from the main structure so we'd have enough room for our feet to fit in.

With Zoom Turbo in the forefoot, a shank in the midfoot, and Zoom Air in the heel, its cushioning system is spot on! We experienced a great mix of bounce and shock absorption, so playing in these hoopers was great fun. Despite being ready to jump, the 21 didn't feel unstable or wobbly, as its substantial structure made us surefooted in every single one of our game tests. Its high-quality materials definitely also made it a quite durable pair and helped us prevent ankle injuries. Just keep in mind that your feet will suffer throughout the long and harsh break-in period these LeBrons need. The shoe's skyrocketed price might hurt your wallet too, but it's definitely worth every penny!

Don't sleep on it if you're looking for: A model with incredibly good cushioning technologies (Zoom Turbo, Zoom Air). A pair that offers great stability and a supportive design. A hooper that adapts to different playstyles because of its overall wonderful performance. High-quality materials in a super stylish reimagined version. Who should not buy We hope your feet are ready for what's coming. First of all, we loved this shoe from head to toe but... this shoe didn't love us that much at the beginning. Its break-in period is painful, and we ended up with blisters and sore Achilles for a while. It was worth it, though, as long as you can endure it, we can assure you this is an amazing pair. If you don't want to know anything about break-in periods (which is totally understandable), you should have a look at the Nike LeBron NXXT GEN , which also has high-quality materials but in a more comfy build. Your browser does not support the video tag. If you wanna play streetball, we believe it's better to go for the Nike Cosmic Unity 3 . Its hard and sturdy rubber outsole is unmatched when it comes to abrasion resistance. Cushioning Shock absorption New Our machine recorded a solid shock absorption measurement of 102 SA in the shoe's heel, where a large Zoom Air unit is responsible for cushioned landings. Meanwhile, the Zoom Turbo unit in the ball of the foot area helped to raise the shoe's forefoot reading even higher than average at 94 SA. This implies plenty of toe joint and ball of foot protection for those intense games that keep you on your toes until the last minute! That excellent impact protection in a lower-stack platform makes the LeBron 21 a great option for versatile and aggressive players like The King himself. These athletes rely on balanced platforms that offer great cushioning without disconnecting them from the court. Heel Forefoot Test results LeBron 21 102 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New Packed with Nike's top-tier Zoom units, Cushlon foam, and a top-loaded shank, it is no surprise that the LeBron 21 exhibited above-average energy return. It is a springy and dynamic shoe with a 65.7% rebound in the heel and a 63.9% one in the forefoot. These even results reflect the LeBron 21's energetic yet balanced ride. Heel Forefoot Test results LeBron 21 63.9% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack At 26.6 mm, this shoe's heel stack is lower than average. We believe this just because of our caliper said so, as the feeling on our foot was not that one of a low stack regarding cushioning! Test results LeBron 21 26.6 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack At 22.4 mm, the forefoot stack of these LeBrons is pretty close to the average. Test results LeBron 21 22.4 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop At 4.2 mm, this shoe's drop is significantly lower than average and feels a lot more like a Kobe shoe. A low-drop offset implies that the foot sits almost parallel to the court as opposed to having a raised heel, as in the 7-8 mm drop shoes. This setup promotes better ground feedback, stability, and faster reaction. Test results LeBron 21 4.2 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. To measure the softness of a shoe's midsole accurately, we need to cut it in half. Then, when we can access this piece nicely, we press our durometer against it and wait for a result. At 26.5 HA, the LeBron 21's Cushlon foam turned out to be of average softness. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results LeBron 21 26.5 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Nike LeBron 21 fits slightly small (290 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit When we measured the toebox width at the widest part, our caliper returned 102.7 mm. It's an average score, and our standard width feet were pretty happy wit it. Nevertheless, we can't recommend this model to wide-feet hoopers, as it might be too snug for their bigger feet. We absolutely loved the dual colour of this model. We think it brings a new and original style to an already iconic pair, and the fact that the details of both shoes are on the same tones is just so aesthetically pleasing! This shoe follows methodology 1.8. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results LeBron 21 102.7 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width At 75.7 mm, our caliper agrees this model tappers quite a lot towards the tip. That's why we believe wide-foot hoopaholics won't find this pair comfortable. Their toes might feel cramped, but this isn't something we didn't expect from a Nike shoe, honestly. If you're looking for an elite model that adapts to wide feet and you don't mind changing brands, you might enjoy the Adidas Harden Vol 7 . This shoe follows methodology 1.8. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results LeBron 21 75.7 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New A shoe that carries the basketball royalty's name cannot afford to have poor traction. And we are here to confirm that the Lebron 21 lives up to the hype! The shoe returned a very high coefficient of friction (0.88) in our grip test which involved sliding its forefoot against a professional court surface with an applied force of 500N. On foot, this means an amazingly tacky bite in all directions and a minimal need for wiping on dusty courts. And just when you think that it can't get any better, Nike releases the LeBron 22 with a whopping 0.95 coefficient of friction! Test results LeBron 21 0.88 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New The Nike LeBron 21 uses translucent rubber with very thin tread lines for the outsole. And because of the latter, we can't recommend this shoe for outdoor use - the delicate nature of its treading is just not ready for the rigors of the blacktop. Flexibility / Stiffness New The LeBron 21 is a stiffer shoe that requires an above-average force of 24.4N to bend by 30 degrees. It is an optimal setup for bigs and players with a power-based game, as the added stiffness makes the shoe more stable and supportive. However, it can feel restrictive and unyielding for the more agile players and requires a break-in period to feel at home on the foot. New test (recommended) Old test Test results LeBron 21 24.4N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight Tougher materials, a thicker outsole, loads of padding... of course this is gonna have an effect on the weight! At 14.2 oz/403.0g, this shoe is lighter than the previous iteration , and the materials felt premium on our feet. LeBron is a power forward, and if you've ever seen him on the court, you'll know he's a big guy. He doesn't need to be as fast as a guard in his moves, so his shoe's design didn't really focus on that. Nevertheless, the model we're reviewing is the NEW LeBron 21, which is an updated and lighter version of the original. With that being said, its weight didn't stop us from making quick fakes, crossover steps, or dribbles. It was nice for our pick-and-rolls, too! It felt nice on our feet, and we didn't mind some extra oz if that meant we got to use this shoe longer. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results LeBron 21 14.2 oz (403g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability Just by looking at these LeBrons, we knew they'd prioritise durability. So... what about breathability? Well, let's see! Your browser does not support the video tag. It looks like we were totally right. Neither LeBron's nor Shaq's shoes would be able to earn a living being yoga instructors. The Reebok Shaq Attaq got a sad 1/5 in our breathability test, and the LB 21? Uh-oh... we're afraid it got the exact same punctuation! Another disappointing 1/5. Your browser does not support the video tag. As we can see in our light test, only the tongue has some holes, but that was not enough to let our feet breathe during our wear tests. Our microscope confirmed it, look at the material! Even though you might see some round details, those are definitely not pores. This model is built to last, and its upper agrees! Nothing to be found in the close-up either. The material is solid, no pores at all! Test results LeBron 21 3 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Following the general features of this model, we definitely expected it to be quite stable. And not only because of that, but also because we're talking about a pair of LeBron shoes after all! The King needs some stability for his crazy plays, and we couldn't wait to see what our feet had to say about this. Your browser does not support the video tag. As expected, we felt surefooted and well-supported. Our ankles didn't wobble, which is something we really appreciate when we play. Why? Well, because if we feel unstable in our new hoopers, we don't have that much confidence when we're trying to play. Doesn't that happen to you too? Your browser does not support the video tag. Nevertheless, this model made sure that didn't happen. Our overall experience regarding stability was pretty nice, as we felt safe and sound during our playtests. Torsional rigidity Great stability comes with... great torsional rigidity. Your browser does not support the video tag. We tried our best to bend the shoe, but it was pretty hard for our thumbs! You can see it in the video, we're clearly struggling. That's why we gave this model a well-deserved 5/5 in our torsional rigidity test, what a toughie! The only bad thing that comes with a high torsional rigidity is... a break-in period. And let us tell you, this shoe's break-in period? Definitely a killer, we ended up with blisters! Still, we'd say this is pretty much the only big con we have for this model. The shoe itself is amazing! Test results LeBron 21 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness Now let's talk a little bit more about those blisters, shall we? Your browser does not support the video tag. Just look at how incredibly stiff this LeBron's heel counter is. Oh, my! It doesn't even bend a little bit when we press our thumb against it. This sure meant some incredibly good lockdown feel, but it also came with a downside: heel rubs. It really hurt our skin, and we ended up with some painful blisters at the end of the day. This model is definitely full of power, but you gotta tame it first! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results LeBron 21 5 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot A wide platform is a must when we talk about stability, and big players like LeBron (in every sense of the word, though) definitely need it! At 120.5 mm, this shoe's midsole width in the forefoot is far bigger than average. We wanted to jump in the lab because of the happiness this caliper reading made us feel. In our games, this translated into us being able to land safely. We could push for any rebound, and we were not taken aback even if in the jump ball we were facing a bigger person. Test results LeBron 21 120.5 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The heel was also a bit wider than average, but nothing too big this time. At 91.6 mm, this extra space is something we could only appreciate as the overall feeling in our heel was pretty snug. No heel slippage, no weird heel moves... nothing to worry about! Test results LeBron 21 91.6 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability It doesn't really matter if you're a huge basketball fan, if you only watch the NBA from time to time, or if you don't care that much about this sport... we all know who LeBron James is. This legendary hooper is well-known for his aggressive plays under the rim, so it's only natural that his shoes are ready to match his playstyle. Your browser does not support the video tag. We knew it right after watching this video. Our Dremel struggled a lot to damage this shoe's upper minimally. The LeBron 21 resisted the attack calmly, and its striking defense earned it a 5/5 in our toebox durability test. Look at that! It literally looks like we accidentally bumped our toes, not that a rolling tool at a 5K RPM speed and 3.2N pressure tried to destroy our shoe. Here we have the two ends of the durability spectrum. On the left, the Nike LeBron 21 and its magnificent 5/5 in our toebox durability test. On the right, the Nike Precision 6 and its disappointing 1/5 in this same test. Test results LeBron 21 5 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability After the amazing durability of its toebox, we were wondering if the heel padding would be that much of a fighter too. Your browser does not support the video tag. With an average score of 3/5, we actually couldn't complain. The heel is the weakest point of every shoe, so we're not that surprised when our Dremel damages it more than the toebox. It didn't look that bad, though. Also, as you can probably guess from the image, there's a considerable amount of padding in that area. We decided to cut the shoe in half to see it better, look: Your browser does not support the video tag. As we were saying before, we really can't complain! There are far worse results, let us give you an example. This is what the Reebok Answer DMX 's heel looked like after our Dremel went all out on it. It scored a 1/5 in our heel padding durability test, we just couldn't give it anything higher! Test results LeBron 21 3 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness At 84.5 HC, the outsole hardness of this LeBron pair is slightly above average. This result promises a good balance between grip and durability, and our wear tests couldn't agree more. Its traction felt quite reliable (we'll talk about it later on) and, regarding durability, all we can do is ask our Dremel! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results LeBron 21 84.5 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability For our outsole durability test, we grabbed our Dremel once again. This time at 10K RPM and 3.2N, the attack of our tool lasted 22 seconds. Your browser does not support the video tag. If you only watch our video, you might think the Dremel wasn't even touching the outsole, as it's barely moving! This was already telling us that good things were coming... and we were absolutely right. A minimal dent of 0.5 mm appeared when we finally put the tool aside. This is notably less deep than average, which clearly indicates the material is hard and resistant. We're loving it, Nike! Test results LeBron 21 0.5 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness As the outsole material is pretty hard, this part of the shoe doesn't need to be that thick. At 4.6 mm, our caliper indicated it's still thicker than average. This means the shoe's outsole won't lose its integrity any time soon. Time to hoop until you can no more! Test results LeBron 21 4.6 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness We do love us a nice and thick insole, and the LB 21 knows it well! At 5.7 mm, we felt it was comfortable during our playtests. This thick insole + the Zoom Turbo at the forefoot + the Zoom Air at the heel = A fun and snappy ride. This combination made us enjoy every moment we had on the court, as we felt our energy was limitless thanks to the shoe's pop underfoot. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results LeBron 21 5.7 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole Just in case you need to use your own orthotics, this LeBron pair has a removable insole. Honestly, we were pretty happy with how it performed during our playtests. But there'll be no problem if you want to change it, which is always a plus! As you can see in these pictures, the insoles come in different colours, matching the aesthetic of each shoe. We are OBSESSED! Test results LeBron 21 Yes Reflective elements We could see some fading light coming from the translucent Swoosh, but no, this shoe doesn't have any reflective elements. It's not made to play streetball after all, so we didn't mind it didn't have any despite it's hefty price tag. Test results LeBron 21 No Tongue padding A thickly padded tongue is the final touch to the overall locked-in feel this shoe offered us. At 12.5 mm, our caliper confirmed that we wouldn't get any kind of bite or uncomfortable rub coming from the laces. Our instep was happily welcomed by a plush hug, and we loved it! Test results LeBron 21 12.5 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type We were pretty surprised when we removed this shoe's laces and faced its non-gusseted tongue. This design made sure our feet had no problem getting into the shoe. With its padded interiors, rigid and stable structure, and top eyelets, we didn't feel any less containment. There's also a lace in the middle of the tongue that makes sure it doesn't slip or dance from side to side, which is something we usually find pretty annoying! Test results LeBron 21 None Heel tab There's a colourful pull-tab at the back of this model. In this colorway, it's the blue-ish flap we can see at the top of the heel. We didn't find it extremely helpful to put on and off the shoe, but we liked the design choice and the aesthetics. Also, let's not forget this pair has a non-gusseted tongue, so sliding our feet into it wasn't hard at all! The shoe offered us a wide and welcoming opening. Thank you, Nike!

Hustle 3 Nike G.T. Hustle 3 review Dimitrije Curcic On on Aug 12, 2024 - updated  Jul 2, 2025 | Reviewed using methodology 1.8 Our verdict The G.T. Hustle 3 breaks completely with the previous iteration, offering an incredibly breathable and cushioned structure. We couldn't get enough of its wonderful Nike technologies (Zoom Air) during our wear tests, as they offered shock absorption, great bounce, and a comfortable ride. We enjoyed the snug fit of this Nike pair, as its lightweight design and fantastic traction helped us with faster moves (like back-door cuts, for example). The problem is that its high-quality design is not on the affordable side, as it also fixed many of the negative aspects of its predecessor. It's quite an investment, but we do believe it's definitely worth it!

Hustle 3 and its game-changing features if you are: A Nike lover or a tech nerd who's constantly looking for state-of-the-art designs. Looking for an extra cushioned model that offers wonderful impact protection and bounce. Who should NOT buy Forget about this Nike pair if you like to feel the court when you play basketball. The G.T. Hustle 3 features a quite high sole that separates your feet off the ground and it felt quite elevated during our wear tests. We believe the LeBron NXXT Gen might be a great alternative, as it offers a fine balance of court feel and impact protection with a nice bounce in the forefoot. Your browser does not support the video tag. Because of its wonderful design, the G.T. Hustle 3 is pretty expensive. Even though we believe it's worth every penny, you might want to check out m ore affordable hoopers . You can use the interactive filters of our page to change the price ranges and find the pair that best suits your wallet and preferences! Cushioning Shock absorption New The G.T. Hustle 3 rivals the G.T. Jump 2 for the title of the most cushioned basketball shoe on the market. Heavily loaded with midsole foam, both shoes returned the highest shock absorption measurements in our lab. The Hustle 3, in particular, is equally generously cushioned in the heel (117 SA) and in the forefoot (120 SA) which is a rare occurrence as hoop shoes tend to be thicker in the heel. This makes it ideal for players who prioritize comfort and joint protection. Heel Forefoot Test results G.T. Hustle 3 117 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New But the G.T. Hustle 3 doesn't just swallow the impact, it launches you right back into the next step, jump, or sprint. Our machine recorded an above-average energy return in the shoe's heel (61.7%), but its forefoot propulsion beats all the records with a sky-high reading of 81.5%! That enormous Zoom Air unit pays off on vertical jumps! Heel Forefoot Test results G.T. Hustle 3 81.5% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack When our caliper returned 32.8 mm, we understood some of our feelings during our playtests. First of all, this shoe's heel stack is higher than average. But it wasn't only our caliper that was sure of this, our feet were pretty positive too! We felt pretty high off the ground when we played in this shoe, which didn't exactly lead to complete instability, but to... some kind of unsafe feeling. Your browser does not support the video tag. You see, the higher the platform, the more unstable one usually feels. And we can't say we felt like we were losing our balance in this pair, but if you prefer to be closer to the court, you should definitely skip it! Test results G.T. Hustle 3 32.8 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack At 26.8 mm, the G.T. Hustle 3's forefoot stack is also higher than average. Once again, this didn't let us feel the court under our feet. So even though we didn't have as much control over our moves, this leg-saving height made us feel incredibly comfortable. This Nike felt soft underfoot, and our feet were pretty happy in their nice bed. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results G.T. Hustle 3 26.8 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop Both the heel and the forefoot stacks led us to an average drop of 6.0 mm. In other words, this hooper felt natural, no surprises here. Going up and down the court and walking from one line to another was really nice, and our feet didn't have to get used to anything new. Test results G.T. Hustle 3 6.0 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. When our durometer returned 29.0 HA, we were pretty surprised. This result indicates that this Nike's midsole is not as soft as the average, even if it's just for a little bit. Still, it offered us a forgiving ride full of technologies, which meant our feet wouldn't get as tired as with other shoes. Thank you for all this comfort, Nike! Test results G.T. Hustle 3 29.0 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Nike G.T. Hustle 3 fits half size small (79 votes). Consider sizing up Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit Players with average-width feet should not have any trouble with the G.T. Hustle 3's fit. Based on the measurements we took from the gel mold of its interiors, this hoop shoe doesn't deviate from the average. Your browser does not support the video tag. Our caliper returned a slightly above-average width of 94.6 mm. It is a solid D medium fit. New test (recommended) Old test Test results G.T. Hustle 3 94.6 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width You can also expect enough room for all five toes thanks to the shoe's rounded toebox shape. Its taper angle is very mild and reflectes in a wider reading of 72.4 mm near the big toe. New test (recommended) Old test Test results G.T. Hustle 3 72.4 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height With a toebox height of 24.3 mm, this Nike shoe never put pressure on top of our toes either. Test results G.T. Hustle 3 24.3 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New The G.T. Hustle 3 offers good traction but it's not impressive considering the shoe's upper-tier pricing. Our grip testing machine recorded just a moderate friction coefficient of 0.68, whereas a similarly priced Nike LeBron 22 returned a whopping 0.95! Test results G.T. Hustle 3 0.68 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New The Hustle 3's concentric tread pattern features long lines from the heel to the forefoot. It also has a deep flex groove on the lateral side of the forefoot which opens up along with the bending of our foot. There's also the big white cavity with the Swoosh in the rearfoot, which helps to reduce the shoe's weight. Flexibility / Stiffness New We didn't feel it was hard to move around the court with this shoe, but we believe it needs a short break-in period to offer its full comfort. Our flex test machine returned a measurement of 25.9N, confirming that the G.T. Hustle 3 requires more force to bend compared to an average basketball shoe. New test (recommended) Old test Test results G.T. Hustle 3 25.9N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight Even though the G.T. Hustle 2 and the G.T. Hustle 3 are completely different shoes, we expected Nike to keep some of the best features of the older sibling. Nevertheless, at 13.1 oz/370g, this hooper is 1.1 oz/30g heavier than its predecessor. It's still lighter than average, though! But we didn't feel slow with this shoe. During our wear tests, we could run up and down the court with no problems, as our feet were not being pushed all the way back to the floor. Also, this Nike has a forefoot rocker that favors easy transitions. In other words, the G.T. Hustle 3 didn't stop us at all. Quite the contrary, we'd say! Test results G.T. Hustle 3 13.1 oz (370g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability The G.T. Hustle 3 breaks completely from the previous version, and it starts with its breathability! Your browser does not support the video tag. We literally couldn't believe our eyes: look at all the smoke coming out of the toebox! Especially if we compare it with the Nike Book 1 and its 1/5; the poor thing wouldn't survive a hot summer even if tried. Your browser does not support the video tag. Our light test gave it away. The knit upper lets the light shine through with no problems at all, which means the material also lets the air go in and out. That's exactly how we felt during our wear tests. Even if we wore this shoe on a hot summer afternoon, our feet still felt energized and ready to hoop some more. Our microscope showed the tiny gaps between the threads, which explains why it was so easy for this Nike to let the smoke out. We've decided to give the G.T. Hustle 3 a solid 5/5 in breathability. We don't need any further evidence! Test results G.T. Hustle 3 5 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test The result of our lateral stability test is yet another reason why we can't say this shoe is unstable. Your browser does not support the video tag. Just look at that! The knit upper provided great containment, limiting our moves to avoid potential injuries. In other words, the lighter testers among us did not feel super stable in this shoe, but it definitely has nothing to do with its upper. Torsional rigidity Our fingers had such a hard time trying to bend this shoe... check it out! Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see, the upper didn't move easily, but the higher platform was a bit more agreeable in that aspect. That's why we decided to give the G.T. Hustle a 4/5 on our torsional rigidity test. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results G.T. Hustle 3 4 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness We found the heel of this shoe incredibly solid and supportive, so we gave it a 4/5 on our heel counter stiffness test. Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see, the extra padded sides bent in easily, yet the area of the Achilles tendon didn't even bow a little bit! Overall, this shoe is incredibly padded, and its upper is solid, leaving no wiggle room. Your browser does not support the video tag. Consequently, this Nike offers a snug fit that hugged our feet comfortably during our wear tests. Test results G.T. Hustle 3 4 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot At 116.5 mm, our caliper indicated this shoe's midsole width in the forefoot is slightly wider than average. Even though we'll talk about this later on, we really liked that deep lateral groove in the outsole. We could feel it work and give some extra flexibility to our moves during our wear tests. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results G.T. Hustle 3 116.5 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The midsole width in the heel is slightly narrower than average at 88.2 mm. Nevertheless, this didn't have a negative effect on the shoe's stability or anything like that! Test results G.T. Hustle 3 88.2 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability After the over-the-top results we got on our breathability test, we didn't know if the upper would show great durability. You know, there are many times were well-ventilated materials end up being less resistant to abrasion. Let's hear our Dremel's opinion! Your browser does not support the video tag. At 5K RPM and with 3.2N of force, the tool was ready to fight this Nike's knit. But... wait, what? The threads are flying around? Is the Hustle 3 actually fighting back the Dremel? Wow, it did fight back! The upper is pretty much undamaged, so we've decided it deserves a wonderful 4/5 on our toebox durability test. If you want to see what a lower grade on this same test looks like, check the poor Nike Precision 6 and its 1/5. Now that's rough. Test results G.T. Hustle 3 4 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability Our expectations were already pretty high, but we still bore in mind that the heel is a very fragile spot in shoes. Just imagine all the friction that occurs in this area during basketball games! Jumping, rebounding, changing directions quickly... all this means a constant rubbing on the Achilles area. Your browser does not support the video tag. Once again, this shoe left us with our mouths wide open. Just look at the minimal damage that our Dremel did to the heel padding. You can barely see it! So we've decided to give it a splendid 4/5 on our heel padding durability test. If you want to see what a real mess looks like (a.k.a. a 1/5 on this same test), check the comparison of the G.T. Hustle 3 with the Reebok Answer DMX . Test results G.T. Hustle 3 4 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness We turned this shoe upside down to measure the durability of its outsole. Our durometer returned 84.3 HC, which means it's pretty much as hard as the average. In most cases, this means the rubber offers a great mix of durability and grip. Test results G.T. Hustle 3 84.3 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability We asked our Dremel one last time to check the G.T. Hustle 3's durability for us, but this time we focused on the outsole. Your browser does not support the video tag. After 22 seconds of non-stop drilling, the tool managed to leave a bite mark of 1.2 mm, which is pretty much average. The G.T. Hustle 2 ended up with a dent of only 0.5 mm, making it more suitable to play streetball. Even though you can also play outdoors with the G.T. Hustle 3, its outsole most likely won't last as long. Test results G.T. Hustle 3 1.2 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness Our caliper returned 4.0 mm when we measured this shoe's outsole. It's an average result, which means that the G.T. Hustle 3 most likely focuses on keeping the weight low with its slightly harder-than-average rubber. Test results G.T. Hustle 3 4.0 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness Do you remember that we mentioned a couple of times (yeah, maybe a little bit more than a couple...) how comfortable we felt in this shoe? Well, the insole and our caliper now know what that's all about! At 8.2 mm, the G.T. Hustle 3's insole is a solid 44% thicker than average. This, added to the cushioning technologies of this model, translated into a wonderfully comfortable ride indoors and outdoors. In fact, this Nike pair would be fantastic to play streetball if its outsole was made with slightly more durable material! Your browser does not support the video tag. It features the right design and technologies to protect the feet from tough jumps, and we loved every bit of it! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results G.T. Hustle 3 8.2 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole We liked this pair's insole, but just in case you don't, you can always change it! As you might already know, we're huge fans of removable insoles! You can change them for the ones of your liking or use your own orthotics, which is essential for some hoopers. Test results G.T. Hustle 3 Yes Reflective elements Nike decided not to add any reflective elements to this model. We were pretty surprised yet once again, as the previous iteration does include some shiny details. Well, this works as another clear evidence of why the G.T. Hustle 3 and 2 feel like completely different shoes! Test results G.T. Hustle 3 No Tongue padding We loved this shoe's tongue padding, and at 9.0 mm, it's pretty close to average. As you can see in the picture, there are 2 main padded areas. The one that goes over the instep, which has a thinner padding; and the one where we tend to tie our laces, which is thicker. Not only did this help reduce the G.T. Hustle 3's overall weight, it also added protection to the key areas, saving us from any kind of lace bite. Test results G.T. Hustle 3 9.0 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type We are not gonna lie here: for this shoe's price, we did expect a gusseted tongue. So we were pretty surprised when we saw this Nike model had a non-gusseted tongue! It's true that this reduced the G.T. Hustle 3's weight and that it didn't have a negative effect on the shoe's overall containment, though. Test results G.T. Hustle 3 None Heel tab This shoe doesn't have a finger loop or any other helpful detail. Nevertheless, as it's got a non-gusseted tongue, the opening is wide enough to fit the feet with no problems.

The Nike Ja 1 is a total performer that we recommend for different kinds of players: from guards who appreciate a lot of energy return to heel strikers and bigger men who need good impact protection. It also feels comfortable enough to be worn off the court. You can really maximize the money spent on this hoop shoe.

Even though our lab tests showed that the shoe's upper is highly resistant to abrasion, we must admit that they don't have a premium vibe. High-quality shoe lovers are better off getting the more upscale Nike KD 15 . Your browser does not support the video tag. Ja Morant's first signature shoe is also not for those who want kicks that they can immediately use straight out of the box. Several parts of this shoe, particularly the midsole tooling and the upper, take some time before they unleash their true potential. The Jordan Luka 1 is a better pick for them. Cushioning Heel stack Immediately upon wearing it, we noticed that the Ja 1 brought us closer to the floor. This allowed us to gain more ground feel and better movement control. Our caliper measurements confirmed our experience. This lab device reported that the Ja 1's heel stack is thinner than usual at 27.5 mm. Test results Ja 1 27.5 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack The thickness of the forefoot is just around the average at 22.3 mm. What's even more interesting about this part is the Zoom Unit embedded in it. This energizing unit gave us all the propulsion that we needed to drive toward the basket and make our games extra exciting. Test results Ja 1 22.3 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop With a drop of only 5.2 mm, this Nike basketball shoe indeed felt flatter than the typical hoop shoe. We appreciated this setup because (1) it made us feel more grounded and (2) it provided just the right blend of impact protection and court feel. This shoe was perfectly suitable for those among us who have more hybrid playing styles and on-court roles. Test results Ja 1 5.2 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. With a softness rating of 26.5 HA, the midsole of the Nike Ja 1 does not deviate in a significant way from the average. Your browser does not support the video tag. Fortunately, its apparent averageness did not result in any negative experience. On the contrary, its midsole setup actually allowed us to enjoy a good balance between cushioning and firmness, which helped greatly with our movements. Test results Ja 1 26.5 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Nike Ja 1 fits slightly small (297 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit Compared to the average, the toebox of the Ja 1 from Nike offers a bit more space. Using a caliper, we learned that the toebox opens 103.0 mm at its widest. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Ja 1 103.0 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width At 75.6 mm, the toebox at the big toe is just as wide as the average. Given that the widest part of the toe box has a bit more space, we are happy that this shoe can indeed accommodate those players with slightly wider feet. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Ja 1 75.6 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Flexibility / Stiffness To test for flexibility, we measured how much force is needed to bend the shoe at 90 degrees. We found that the Nike Ja 1 only needed 34.7N, which is 16.4% lower than the amount of force that the typical hoop shoe would need. The shoe's quite flexible structure allowed for more natural twists and bends of our feet, effectively comfort and our range of motion. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Ja 1 34.7N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight At only 12.7 ounces or 361.0 grams, the Ja 1 from Nike is truly lighter than the typical basketball shoe. On the court, its lightweight structure allowed us to be speedier and less restricted with our movements. Test results Ja 1 12.7 oz (361g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability In our lab test, the smoke that we pumped into the shoe escaped through the tongue well. Though the smoke's rising was not as smooth as in the Under Armour Curry 10 , the Ja 1 still deserved a solid 3 out of 5 for ventilation. This score still makes it more breathable than many other basketball shoes on record. Your browser does not support the video tag. Nike Ja 1 (3 out of 5) vs. UA Curry 10 (5 out of 5) Putting the upper material over the light source quickly revealed that the upper material wasn't as well-ventilated as we hoped. Much of the ventilation for this shoe was through the tongue. Your browser does not support the video tag. We examined the upper material through the microscope and saw that a tightly woven lining underneath the mesh hampered its ability to \"breathe.\" It's very clear in the close-up shot below how the lining effectively closes off the mesh patterns where air could have flowed. Test results Ja 1 3 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Even if the materials felt cheap, they never fell short in providing much-needed support. When we moved from side to side, we felt so much response from the sidewalls. It is important to note that while it was supportive, it never felt restrictive. The upper still afforded us some flexibility to accommodate splays and some inevitable in-motion foot displacements, as can be seen in the video below. Torsional rigidity There was practically nothing to complain about when it came to this Nike shoe's torsional resistance. We felt so protected from twists even on awkward angles. Hands down, this shoe truly deserved the perfect 5 it got from us. Test results Ja 1 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness What we liked about the heel counter was that it was straight-up stiff. The moment we put the shoe on, we already felt its grasp on the rearfoot. It was secure but not tight. After giving it a good squeeze in our lab, we gladly give the heel counter a solid 4 out of 5 for stiffness. Test results Ja 1 4 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot The shoe felt stable at the forefoot, and we attribute this stability to the wide platform in that area. Using our caliper, we found that the midsole platform is wider than average at 115.4 mm wide at the forefoot. Test results Ja 1 115.4 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel Surprisingly, the heel area is A LOT narrower than usual. Fortunately, this did not result in any performance issues. On the contrary, tapering the platform in the heel area quite a bit helped in reducing the weight of the shoe. Test results Ja 1 82.4 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability Toebox durability is where the Nike Ja 1 shone like a gem it is. Not even our high-pressure Dremel-drilling for twelve seconds could poke a hole through it. So hands down, it's a 5 over 5! Your browser does not support the video tag. For context, take a look at the damage the same amount of pressure placed on the Adidas Harden Stepback 3 , which only got a 3 out of 5. Nike JA 1 (5 out of 5) vs. Adidas harden Stepback 3 (3 out of 5) Test results Ja 1 5 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability The durability of the heel counter padding was also another highlight. If only it could laugh, it would have LOLed at our Dremel test! If we could give a score higher than 5 out of 5, we would! Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see, four seconds of drilling barely left a dent on the heel counter. Test results Ja 1 5 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness The hardness of the outsole wasn't so bad during our test games. In the lab, our HC durometer showed that it is just around the average in this regard. Test results Ja 1 83.1 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability Just like the upper and the heel counter padding, the outsole was also subjected to our standard Dremel drilling to see how abrasion-resistant it is. Your browser does not support the video tag. Using a tread gauge, we measured the dent depth at 1.6 mm. This is notably deeper than average, indicating that the material is softer. Using this frequently outdoors might not be such a good idea. Test results Ja 1 1.6 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness Our caliper showed that the outsole is only 3.5 mm thick, making it just a tiny bit thinner than average. Coupled with its not-so-impressive durability, we can say that this shoe is best for well-kept indoor hardwood courts. Test results Ja 1 3.5 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness We attribute the comfortable feeling underfoot to the insole, which we found to be a little thicker than average at 5.0 mm. Test results Ja 1 5.0 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole The Nike Ja 1 is ready for players who might want to wear custom orthotics during their games. Its insole is removable so that space can be freed up when needed. Test results Ja 1 Yes Tongue padding The tongue is slightly more padded than average. Our caliper measured its thickness to be 10.4 mm. Because it contains this much material, the top of our feet felt sufficiently protected from lace pressure. Test results Ja 1 10.4 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type The Nike Ja 1 has a semi-gusseted tongue, and it truly contributed a lot to the lockdown that we enjoyed while playing in it. We never had to worry about any unnecessary internal slides and shifts. Test results Ja 1 Both sides (semi) Heel tab The Ja 1 does not have any heel tab. But there is absolutely no need to worry because this shoe was quite easy to put on and take off even without this extra feature.

Its versatility lets it fit different playstyles, as it feels fast yet stable on foot. No matter if you post-play a lot or if you're more of a dribble-tricky player, this Nike pair will work with you. It features a springy Zoom Air Unit and a low profile structure that balance each other out in the best way possible. Nevertheless, we believe it lacks support for its price, which was disappointing.

You want the best court feel for dynamic footwork. You change positions often so you need a pair that will give you a little bit of everything. Who should NOT buy The Freak 6's underfoot experience turned out to be underwhelming, especially compared to the equally grounded yet amazingly responsive Sabrina 2 . Your browser does not support the video tag. Also, despite its wonderful traction, the outsole of the Giannis Freak 6 lacks durability for the outdoors. Have a look at our streetball hoopers collection instead. If you're looking for something durable and with the much needed support this shoe is lacking, the Nike Ja 1 may be your next partner on the court. Cushioning Shock absorption New Built for agility and speed, the Freak 6 is not the shoe to choose if you seek great cushioning. Its below-average shock absorption measurements of 92 SA in the heel and 75 SA in the forefoot reflect this Nike shoe's groundedness and more sensitive court feel. Heel Forefoot Test results Giannis Freak 6 92 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New However, we did expect much better responsiveness from this Giannis shoe. Despite having a Zoom unit in its forefoot, the Freak 6 failed to reach above-average energy return in the forefoot, showing just a standard reading of 58.8%. Its heel exhibited even less rebound with a moderate measurement of 50.9%. Heel Forefoot Test results Giannis Freak 6 58.8% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack Our caliper returned 27.3 mm when we measured this shoe's heel stack. Test results Giannis Freak 6 27.3 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack At 21.3 mm, our caliper says there's also not a lot of foam between the toes and the court. Test results Giannis Freak 6 21.3 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop Overall, the Giannis Freak 6 has a low profile and offers great court feel. Following the forefoot and heel stacks, we get a drop of 6.0 mm. In other words, you won't feel your heel up in the sky! During our wear tests, this Nike pair felt rather flat. But we're not saying it in a bad way! It was flat as in close to the court, which made our moves more precise thanks to the extra control. This setup works wonders for quick players who like to play tricks whilst dribbling. Test results Giannis Freak 6 6.0 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. As we believe the Giannis Freak 6 focuses on quick and controlled plays, we didn't think it would have a super soft foam. And we were right! Our durometer returned 28.5 HA, which is slightly higher than average. But this doesn't mean the shoe is uncomfortable or anything like that. It just doesn't feel like stepping on a cloud! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Giannis Freak 6 28.5 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Nike Giannis Freak 6 fits true to size (40 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit The sole flares don't count when we're measuring the toebox width of a shoe! That's why the claws of our caliper don't hug the Giannis Freak 6's whole structure. At the widest part of the toe area, we measured 100.5 mm, which is slightly lower than average. Despite its spacious platform, we don't believe this upper can comfortably fit wide-toed hoop lovers. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Giannis Freak 6 100.5 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width Our second caliper reading just verified it. It returned 75.6 mm, which means this pair tapers towards the tip. We can confirm it now: wide-feet players should stay away from the Giannis Freak 6! This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Giannis Freak 6 75.6 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New The Nike Freak 6 is a fast and furious shoe, largely thanks to its impeccable outsole traction. We tested the shoe's grip by sliding its forefoot against professional basketball flooring with an applied force of 500N. Our machine recorded a solid above-average friction coefficient of 0.85 which proved the shoe's reliable bite for quick cuts, pivots, and sprints. Test results Giannis Freak 6 0.85 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New The Freak 6 features a labyrinthine design with pretty shallow and thin treads which makes it a better choice for indoor courts. The shoe's outsole feels extra tacky on hardwood but wears out instantly on the blacktop. Flexibility / Stiffness New With a medium stiffness measurement of 21.0N, the Giannis Freak 6 offers a well-balanced, Goldilocks-like forefoot flex that's neither too bendy nor too restrictive. Our transitions felt fast and smooth in this Nike shoe. But if you are a nimble player who is used to better proprioception and control over footwork, you might prefer a bendier Nike Sabrina 2 instead. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Giannis Freak 6 21.0N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight During our wear tests running up and down the court, we felt the Giannis Freak 6 was not slowing us down. It fact, to us it felt pretty speedy on foot! Nothing crazy, but performance-wise we were quite satisfied. When we took this Nike pair to our lab, we saw our scale marked 12.3 oz/349.0g, which is a weight lower than average. This translated into quick footwork and comfort, powering up our mobility regardless of the position we played. Your browser does not support the video tag. The best part is that, despite being on the lighter side, the Giannis Freak 6 is super padded! From the double thick heel counter to the collar and the instep, which has two layers. We felt its comfort and lockdown during our playtests, and that gave us a lot of confidence on the court. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Giannis Freak 6 12.3 oz (349g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability During our wear tests, we didn't feel our feet were burning up with their own heat whilst we ran up and down the court. To verify this and put it into numbers, we took the Giannis Freak 6 to our lab. Your browser does not support the video tag. Starting with our light test, we could not find any ventilation gaps around the upper. The light couldn't shine through any area! Your browser does not support the video tag. Nevertheless, when we compared it with the extra hot Air Jordan XXXIX , the Giannis Freak 6 showed us it wouldn't let our feet choke! It began pretty strongly, with a solid column of smoke coming through the toe area and moving towards the tongue. Nevertheless, as the test moved on, it started losing power and consistency. All in all, we have decided to give this Nike pair a middle ground 3/5 on our breathability test. Look at our images using the microscope. There's no way that upper material favors airflow! Test results Giannis Freak 6 3 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Following our experience, this shoe feels stable on foot. It's nothing super crazy, but all the inner padding it has, its lower profile, and its firmer foam worked together to make us feel safe. Your browser does not support the video tag. When we first took the Giannis Freak 6 out of its box, we saw it had a big black piece (in this colorway) right in the middle of its midsole. The first thing we thought was that it could be an outer reinforcement that signaled where the shank of the shoe is. Or any other type or supportive technology. The answer? Well, it was none! It's just a plastic piece. It might offer some extra stability, but we didn't really feel anything coming from it. In fact, we were pretty disappointed to find out this Nike pair doesn't feature a shank. Your browser does not support the video tag. Torsional rigidity The high rubber wall of the Giannis Freak 6 doesn't only add its bits to the overall stability, it also makes it impossible to twist! Your browser does not support the video tag. Our fingers struggled a lot, so we have decided to give this shoe a perfect 5/5 on our torsional rigidity test. Test results Giannis Freak 6 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness Making this shoe's heel counter bow to us was also pretty much impossible! Your browser does not support the video tag. We could move it a slight bit, and that's the only reason why it didn't get the highest grade on this test! All in all, the super padded heel counter earned a well-deserved 4/5 on our heel counter stiffness test. Test results Giannis Freak 6 4 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot Another key point of the fantastic overall stability of this shoe is its midsole width. Our caliper returned 119.1 mm, which makes it way wider than average. Spacious platforms help us a lot when we grab a rebound in traffic and end up collapsing with another player. It's easier to land safely and our feet find their much needed balance way sooner! Test results Giannis Freak 6 119.1 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel However, and quite unexpectedly, this Nike's midsole in the heel is narrower than average. At 87.3 mm, it definitely didn't help with the overall stability. Nevertheless, we always try to land using our forefoot to keep our joints healthy (especially our knees), so we didn't really feel this shoe's heel affected negatively the overall balance. The forefoot did enough for both! Test results Giannis Freak 6 87.3 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability For our toebox durability test, we always set the Dremel at 5K RPM and 3.2N of force. Your browser does not support the video tag. We drilled the Giannis Freak 6 for 12 long seconds. Its upper withstood the abrasion, as it managed to survive without a hole. Even though it doesn't have any extra protective layers on top, the upper fought back bravely. Consequently, we have decided to give this shoe a 3/5 on our toebox durability test. Test results Giannis Freak 6 3 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability We moved the Dremel all the way back to the heel and started our standardized 4-second torture! Your browser does not support the video tag. Even though the damage doesn't look that big, if you look closely you'll see the tool actually destroyed a lot of the material. In fact, a blue-ish lower layer is saying hi! That's why we have decided to give this shoe a 2/5 on our heel padding durability test. Test results Giannis Freak 6 2 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness We pressed our durometer against the Giannis Freak 6's outsole to measure its hardness. It returned 87.0 HC, which usually points at the rubber compound focusing on durability and not so much on grip. This is just the standard, but there are always exceptions to the rule! Test results Giannis Freak 6 87.0 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability Right... so we must've jinxed it. When we attacked the outsole with our Dremel at 10K RPM and 3.2N, the Giannis Freak 6 struggled each and every second of the 22 long ones this test lasted. Your browser does not support the video tag. After putting the tool aside, we realized the damage was even worse than we expected. Our tread gauge returned 1.8 mm, which is a whole 44% deeper than average. And that's a lot, trust us! We would totally not recommend this shoe to play streetball. Its outsole will be destroyed by the outdoor court's harsh surface! Test results Giannis Freak 6 1.8 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness Additionally, the Giannis Freak 6 doesn't feature a thick outsole that has a lot of material to wear down before being unusable. In fact, our caliper returned 3.6 mm, which is even slightly lower than average! Test results Giannis Freak 6 3.6 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness This Nike pair features a standard insole. At 4.4 mm, it's slightly thinner than average, which helped reduce the overall weight of the shoe. Test results Giannis Freak 6 4.4 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole We really like the aesthetics of the Giannis Freak 6's insole, as it includes the full name of the player. But what we like even more is the fact that it's removable! You see, the fact that this shoe does NOT have a shank drove us crazy. We felt it was definitely lacking underfoot support during our wear tests. That's why we believe adding a supportive orthotic might help. Test results Giannis Freak 6 Yes Reflective elements There are no reflective elements in the Giannis Freak 6! In our opinion, this shoe is not ready to play streetball, so it's not like we thought it would really need shiny details to enhance visibility. Test results Giannis Freak 6 No Tongue padding With 9.5 mm of tongue padding, this shoe made the overall experience even more comfortable. Even though we like that Nike focused the protection right where the laces rest, we also believe it could've gone for a thinner tongue. This would reduce the Giannis Freak 6's overall weight and still avoid lace bite, as almost 10 mm of padding is a lot! But we're not complaining, though. Also, this shoe doesn't have an extra eyelet at the top. It's true that we find that detail very convenient, but the lockdown feel thanks to this Nike's overall padded structure and fully gusseted tongue didn't make us wish it had that extra hole. Test results Giannis Freak 6 9.5 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type We were happily welcomed by a fully gusseted tongue when we put on this Nike pair. It hugged our feet comfortably, offering great lockdown and containment. Test results Giannis Freak 6 Both sides (full) Price The Giannis Freak 6 costs $140, which makes it step away from Giannis' budget line and its Immortality pairs . But we just can't believe Nike has gone for a higher price when this model doesn't even feature a shank for support and help when we jump. What's more, we found out it only includes 1 Zoom Air unit, and that's it! No more technologies! In our opinion, there are cheaper and maybe even all-around better options out there. The Giannis Immortality 4 being one of them. Test results Giannis Freak 6 $140 Average $135 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes $70 Price $210 Heel tab This shoe doesn't have any kind of heel tab. As it features a gusseted tongue and there's a lot of padding in the heel area, some kind of lace loop would have definitely been helpful to put the shoe on.

It is supportive, bouncy, and light, and offers a decent amount of court feel. However, we found that it has serious issues with traction on dusty courts, which some players may consider as a deal-breaker.

Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Who should buy the Adidas Dame 8 This basketball shoe from Adidas is a suitable option for basketball players who: play on clean courts all or most of the time have normal-to-wide feet (the toebox is extra roomy) want a well-rounded basketball shoe that is reasonably priced Who should NOT buy the Dame 8 Do NOT get this Adidas shoe if you often play on dusty floors. This is the shoe's weakest point and it collects dust like crazy. For a more consistent grip, we recommend the Adidas Harden Vol. 7 . Your browser does not support the video tag. Also, if you are a narrow-footer, the Dame 8 will most probably just give you a headache with its huge toebox. We confirmed that the Adidas Trae Young 2 has a more form-fitting upper. Plenty of comfort and support in the upper We admire the Adidas Dame 8 for delivering us with a cozy in-shoe feel. We are able to quickly break in the shoe and the material conforms to our foot pretty well - like a nice warm hug. The interiors are also well-padded in the tongue and collar. The latter actually has four bone pillows that embrace the Achilles for enhanced comfort and support. Your browser does not support the video tag. The tongue padding of the Dame 8 is actually not as thick as it can get. We measured it at 6.3 mm, while the average for basketball shoes is 9.5 mm. Overall, we love everything about this aspect of the shoe except for the added layer of padding at the heel. This piece is somewhat fiddly as you have to hold it up when putting on the shoe because it tends to fold in. Added that the heel counter itself is not very structured, a flimsy heel could be a problem for some. On a 1-5 scale where 5 is the stiffest, we rated it as 2. Your browser does not support the video tag. It's a warm shoe Don't let those large mesh pores fool you - the Adidas Dame 8 is not a breathable shoe. What appears like huge ventilation holes turns out to be a pretty tightly-woven fabric. Your browser does not support the video tag. Adidas Dame 8 (left) vs. Nike Zoom Freak 4 (right) Our observations are confirmed in a smoke-machine breathability test. Based on the amount of smoke that passes through the shoe's upper, we rated the Adidas Dame 8 as 2 out of 5 (where 1 is the least breathable). And as you can see from the transparency test below, the shoe's upper has multiple layers which don't let any light shine through. Your browser does not support the video tag. Traction...well...didn't really gain that much traction We found that the traction is OK, especially on clean courts. However, on even mildly dusty surfaces, hard lateral movements can lead to slips. We noticed that this is because the outsole picks up dust quite easily. And what makes it worse is that occasional wiping is not enough: two good stops and then we have to wipe again. Your browser does not support the video tag. And if you are a speedy player, the issue becomes even worse when you have to plant the foot hard and do a quick step back or a crossover. It appears that Adidas was not able to learn from the Dame 7's traction experience. We also found the Dame 7 to only have so-so traction at best. But the outsole has solid durability for outdoors Testing the Dame 8's wear resistance on outdoor courts left us impressed with the durability of its rubber outsole. This is quite surprising given that the outsole on the Adidas Dame 8 is neither very thick nor hard. We measured its outsole thickness at 3.6 mm, whereas the average for our lab-tested basketball shoes is 3.8 mm. The same goes for the firmness of that rubber. On average, basketball shoes that are recommended for outdoor use have a hardness of 79 HC but the Adidas Dame 8 comes in at 76.9 HC. But despite having below-average parameters, the Adidas Dame 8 still makes it to the range of outdoor-friendly shoes. The Dame 8 has strategic cushioning Based on our wear tests, the Dame 8's Bounce Pro delivers a more pleasant cushioning experience than the Dame 7's Lighstrike. It provides a lot of compression in the heel and feels really bouncy. In our subjective opinion, the Bounce Pro also feels springier and more responsive than the Boost. The Bounce Pro setup is also firmer in the forefoot, giving us a pleasant mix of court feel and impact protection. Your browser does not support the video tag. In addition to this, the transition from one step to another felt fluid and extremely smooth. Your browser does not support the video tag. Measuring the heel portion of the midsole, we can definitely confirm that it is on the soft side. Compared to the rest of our lab-tested basketball shoes, the Dame 8 is 34% softer under the heel. Disclaimer: To ensure accuracy, we take four measurements with the durometer. The average between them is our final result. The photo above shows just one of these measurements. When it comes to the amount of cushioning, the Adidas Dame 8 packs just as much of it as most other hoop shoes do. Using a pair of calipers, we measured its heel height at 30.5 mm (2.3 mm thicker than average) and its forefoot at 20.1 mm (0.9 mm thinner). Disclaimer: All stack measurements are taken with the insole included. In the Dame 8, it is of average thickness - 4.2 mm. There is a good deal of flex Speaking of smooth heel-to-toe transitions, we noticed that the Adidas Dame 8 has more flex to it than other basketball shoes. So, if you are not a fan of a stiff ride, this Adidas shoe could be the answer. Your browser does not support the video tag. Even by mere twisting and bending the shoe in our hands, we could already tell that the Dame is among the flexiest. On a scale from 1 to 5, where 5 is the stiffest, we rated the shoe's longitudinal flexibility as 3 out of 5 and its torsional one as 4. For reference, the average for basketball shoes is 3.9 and 4.4 respectively. Your browser does not support the video tag. Now, to prevent bias, we used a resistance gauge while bending the shoe to a 90-degree angle. Our perception was confirmed - the Adidas Dame 8 is 13% more flexible than average. Your browser does not support the video tag. The Dame 8 took care of support, y'all! No complaints! The base of the Dame 8 is fairly wide, so there would be no rollovers. Indeed! The platform of this Adidas shoe is a GREAT deal wider than average. We measured the forefoot and the heel at their widest points and found the following: forefoot (119 mm) - 7.3 mm wider than average heel (99.1 mm) - 8.5 mm wider than average Also, there are no unnecessary side-to-side movements on the footbed based on our actual games. We had no issues with lateral containment even though we did hard pivoting and directional changes. Heel slippage is also a problem we never encountered. Your browser does not support the video tag. Sizing down is very likely We discovered that the Adidas Dame 8 runs a bit long, so you will need to go at least half size down to achieve the right size. The shoe also comes with a roomy toebox that gets even bigger as the material tends to stretch out. This is great news for wide footers as it makes the foot free to be itself. But we advise people with narrow feet to definitely stay away from this Adidas shoe. Compared to the average, the Dame is 1.6 mm wider in the widest part of its forefoot and 1.3 mm wider around the toes. We measure both the widest part of the forefoot as well as the toe area to check if the toebox is tapered. In the case of the Adidas Dame, it is not. It remains wider around the toes than most basketball shoes.

However, we found that it has serious issues with traction on dusty courts, which some players may consider as a deal-breaker."

They are better off wearing the Adidas Dame 8 . Your browser does not support the video tag. Another good pick that we can recommend is the Adidas D.O.N. Issue #4 . Both of these basketball shoes are also lighter than the Adidas Harden Vol. 7, so those who are not happy with the Harden Vol. 7's weight may go for these options. Cushioning Heel stack The midsole brought us closer to the ground, allowing us to feel the courts better. Back in the lab, we've seen that the heel stack is thinner than usual at 27.5 mm. Because of this setup, we are able to improve our agility and control. Test results Harden Vol. 7 27.5 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack Just like the heel, the forefoot is also on the thinner side. Our caliper measurements revealed that it's significantly thinner than average at 18.2 mm. Test results Harden Vol. 7 18.2 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop The drop was measured to be 9.3 mm, and it was particularly supportive of our heel strikes and forward motions. Test results Harden Vol. 7 9.3 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. The moment we put this Adidas basketball shoe on, we already noticed how soft the midsole is. Calling it a pillow for our feet still felt like an understatement! Your browser does not support the video tag. After we assessed the midsole softness using our HA durometer, we were pleasantly surprised by the results. The device gave it a rating of 11.0, making it a good 58% softer than average. Test results Harden Vol. 7 11.0 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Adidas Harden Vol. 7 fits true to size (23 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit We have to say, the Adidas Harden Vol. 7 is a treat for wide-footers. At its widest part, the toebox measured 108.2 mm, far wider than average. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Harden Vol. 7 108.2 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width This shoe did not have the usual problem of tapering too much toward the tip. At the big toe, the toebox measured 85.1 mm. This width is again far greater than usual. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Harden Vol. 7 85.1 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Flexibility / Stiffness That its supportiveness did not sacrifice flexibility is a noteworthy benefit of the Harden Vol. 7. Using a digital force gauge, we learned that this shoe needed only 34.6N of force to bend at 90 degrees. This is much lower than the amount of force needed by the typical hoop shoe. During the games, this flexibility allowed us to move much more freely. The shoe was perfectly able to accommodate the peculiar but natural flexions of our feet. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Harden Vol. 7 34.6N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight It's such a bummer that this Adidas shoe really packed some weight. Even the Harden Stepback 3 , which we already consider to be just a teeny bit on the heavier side, is lighter than this! Our scale reported it to weigh 16.4 ounces or 466 grams. It's definitely heavier than the typical hoop shoe. Our first steps definitely felt heavy, and it really took some getting used to. Test results Harden Vol. 7 16.4 oz (466g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability The Harden Vol. 7's breathability definitely has to be improved. During our tests, smoke could barely pass through the upper material. It's only the tongue that offered just a bit of aeration, and this is the only reason it got a 2 out of 5. Your browser does not support the video tag. Even light found it hard to shine through the upper material. Your browser does not support the video tag. Upon closer inspection with our microscope, we saw clearly that there are just no perforations in the upper. The upper material is so closed that you might as well be wearing a cardboard! Test results Harden Vol. 7 2 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test We had so much confidence in how the shoe clasped our feet during our test games. The sidewalls were sturdy enough to keep our feet in place even as we moved quite intensely up and down the court. Torsional rigidity After doing some manual twists in the lab, we learned that this shoe is a 4 out of 5 when it comes to torsional rigidity. The firmness of this shoe's base helped us a lot in maintaining stability. Not once did we have to worry about painfully twisting our feet. Test results Harden Vol. 7 4 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness Just by feeling it with our bare hands and feet, the heel counter did not give us any reason to doubt its capacity to secure the rearfoot. After giving it a good squeeze in the lab, we were left with no other choice but to give it a 4 out of 5. This rating makes it better than the majority of hoop shoes that we've ever played on. Test results Harden Vol. 7 4 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot A good deal of the stability that we enjoyed was because of the wider-than-average platform of the Adidas Harden Volume 7. As per our caliper measurements, the platform is 116.4 mm wide at the forefoot. Test results Harden Vol. 7 116.4 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The width of the platform at the heel is even more noteworthy. It adds 12% more to the average. Now, that's a lot of extra space for great stability. Test results Harden Vol. 7 102.0 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability It's clear now that the non-breathable upper offers another good thing: noteworthy durability. Our twelve-second Dremel drilling only went through the colored first layer. It got a 4 out of 5, and it truly deserves it! Your browser does not support the video tag. The Adidas Harden Vol. 7 is indeed a jackpot for players who drag their toes a lot. Compared to the damage suffered by the Adidas Harden Stepback 3 after the same test, the mark on this shoe just looks superficial. Adidas Harden Vol. 7 (4 out of 5) vs Adidas Harden Stepback 3 (3 out of 5) Test results Harden Vol. 7 4 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability The durability of the heel counter padding is out of this world. Our Dremel test was no match for it; it's a perfect 5! Your browser does not support the video tag. Post-test, the heel counter just looks like its feathers only got ruffled the wrong way. No structural issues whatsoever. Test results Harden Vol. 7 5 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness This shoe's outsole hardness is just around the average. It got a rating of 82.9 on our HC durometer in the lab. Though this is not the best shoe for the outdoors, using it there once in a while wouldn't hurt. Test results Harden Vol. 7 82.9 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability Durability really is this strong highlight. After doing some Dremel drilling in the lab, we saw that the outsole incurred only 0.5 mm of damage. This makes it 55% more durable than usual! Your browser does not support the video tag. The 0.5 mm damage is way way lower than the damage seen in typical basketball shoes. We do not have any reason to doubt this shoe's durability, and we are definitely going to use this shoe outdoors to our hearts' content. Test results Harden Vol. 7 0.5 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness It's a pleasant surprise that the Adidas Harden Vol. 7 delivers all the durability that we enjoyed without having a specially thick outsole.  Its outsole is only 3.5 mm based on our lab measurements, making it slightly thinner than average. Test results Harden Vol. 7 3.5 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness The removable insole is slightly thinner than the usual. Fortunately, the reduced thickness did not have any significant effect on our experience because of the uber-soft midsole. Test results Harden Vol. 7 3.4 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole The removable insole afforded us more space should there be a need to wear orthotics. Test results Harden Vol. 7 Yes Tongue padding We noticed that the tongue padding is way lower than usual. It's only 4.7 mm thick based on our caliper measurements in the lab. Test results Harden Vol. 7 4.7 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type The sock-like design of the tongue was one of the main reasons support was never an issue. It also prevented debris from getting into the shoe, especially when we were playing outdoors. Test results Harden Vol. 7 Sock like Heel tab The Adidas Harden Volume 7 is equipped with a heel tab that helps us to put on and take off the shoe with ease.

We've found the Adidas Trae Young 3 is a perfect match for those players who want to perform like the NBA's most aggressive guards and need a pair of kicks to keep up with their quick game. In our wear tests, this shoe made us feel stable and surefooted in our every move. And in our lab tests, we discovered it focuses on keeping it low to the ground, so it doesn't have the plushest midsole. Still, we believe it's ideal for athletes who are agile and quick on the court. If your playstyle is all about imposing offenses, sudden sprints, precise dribbling, and dominant cuts, make sure you sign this new assist leader of your shoe game!

We know this shoe will be the collection's MVP of: Guards that have a quick and aggressive playstyle and need something that prioritises ground-contact. Players who want something to keep up with their advanced technique regarding motion control. Wearers that love a grippy and durable sole that can resist their tricky moves in the offense. Hoopers that are looking for a shoe that shines in stability and lockdown. Athletes who play indoors. Who should NOT buy The Trae Young 3 might not be the best option if you're looking for a pair with a durable upper. The Trae Young 2 , despite being the previous iteration, is built using way more heavy-duty materials. But let us warn you: even though it has a slip-on design, it's incredibly tricky to put on! On the contrary, this new model features a traditional lacing system, which makes things easier. Your browser does not support the video tag. If you are a point guard fan or player who wants to hoop it up in the summer, you're gonna need a trustworthy breathable pair. As long as you don't mind changing brands, we recommend the Under Armour Curry 10 , which is not only better ventilated, but also much lighter than the Trae Young 3. Cushioning Heel stack As these teammates are quite heavy, we thought all their weight would go to its cushioning and padding. But our caliper disagreed. At 29.6 mm, the heel stack of this shoe is quite close to the average. So, to say it in a nice way, nothing special. This decision regarding a shoe's design is usually to keep its weight low. Even though it hasn't been the case here, we've got some good news for you. Your browser does not support the video tag. When the stack height is low, we can feel the court closer. This translates into accurate and precise moves. It is starting to sound more like a point guard shoe, right? In our wear test, we definitely felt in control when we were playing. Additionally, this pair does have enough cushioning for our joints not to suffer. In other words, our feet felt the ground, but there was also some impact protection for our jumps. If you're looking for an extra padded companion, the Nike Lebrons are ready to pick and roll you into an extra comfy game experience! Test results Trae Young 3 29.6 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack The same happens with the forefoot stack, but we were not surprised. At 20.7 mm, your toes are pretty close to the ground. Even though this score is just slightly lower than average, it was enough for us to feel the ground and stay stable in our every move. The Trae Young 3's stack heights might not sound like much, but trust us, they are enough to make you feel supported. This model focuses on stability, hence its low stack, but it also makes sure your feet are protected not only from unbalanced steps, but also from impacts. Your browser does not support the video tag. We really enjoyed this mix in our games. Nice one, Adidas! Test results Trae Young 3 20.7 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop The stack of this shoe is not high, and neither is its drop. At 8.9 mm, the difference between the toes and the heel heights is nothing special. Both parts let your feet stay close to the court and, consequently, the platform is low enough to keep you stable at all times. That was exactly our experience with this pair! Your browser does not support the video tag. Look at that, our foot barely even moves when landing! Test results Trae Young 3 8.9 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. Even though this pair's outsole is quite hard and it's made to last, we felt the midsole was different. At 22.5 HA, our durometer told us we were right, as in our playtests we noticed the Trae Young 3's midsole was slightly plush. Yet, once again, nothing compared to the v2's (11.5 HA). Still, we can assure you it doesn't feel like a brick underfoot. Don't worry! Side note: Compared to the previous iteration, this one does not include a secondary foam. Test results Trae Young 3 22.5 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Adidas Trae Young 3 fits true to size (398 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit This might sound confusing, but a wider platform does NOT mean a toebox just as wide! And the Trae Young 3 is a great example. At 100.8 mm, this Adidas shoe is just average, and we do believe this is a wonderful design choice. Why? Because even though the platform is wide and the shoe accommodates wide feet, its snugger toebox makes sure they are supported. You will totally understand what we're talking about just having a look at the picture below. Listen here, we are the ones dancing in the court, not our feet! This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Trae Young 3 100.8 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width As well as in the widest part of the toebox, this shoe is also wider than its predecessor at the big toe. At 76.7 mm, its width is average, but a whole 5.5 mm wider than the v2! This means wide-feet / big-toed players will definitely feel more comfortable. We're loving this design upgrade! This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Trae Young 3 76.7 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Flexibility / Stiffness As the whole structure of these toughies is quite stiff, we knew they wouldn't be super duper flexible. Your browser does not support the video tag. We used a gauge to measure how much force was needed to bend this Adidas shoe to a 90-degree angle. At 40.8N, on the one hand, we were pretty happy, but on the other hand... kind of disappointed. You see, the v2 required only 31.4N in this same test, which means it's more flexible. Your browser does not support the video tag. Regarding our experience, we did feel this in our heel-to-toe transitions. The thing is, the Trae Young 3 is equipped with the brand's Torsion System (which is an Adidas technology that promotes stability), and it doesn't let the shoe bend more than it should. Your browser does not support the video tag. Despite all that, our wear tests proved the v3 does have a comfortable and unrestricted ride. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Trae Young 3 40.8N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight We know that you'll definitely nod if we say that Trae Young is an incredibly talented player. As a point guard, he needs to be extremely fast, so we did expect this shoe to match his strikingly quick attacks. But... that wasn't the case. The crowd would boo at the fact that this version is even slightly heavier than the previous one! (15.0 oz / 425g compared to the v2's 14.8 oz / 420g). We know that's not much of a difference, but honestly, we did expect some improvement in this area. This pair is not only heavier than its predecessor, it's also heavier than average! If you're looking for a lighter option that belongs to another extraordinarily gifted point guard, have a look at the Jordan Luka 1 (12.80 oz / 363g). Test results Trae Young 3 15.0 oz (425g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability When you play sports, your breathing technique is very important. Yes, shoes, we're talking to you! Basketball is a very physically demanding and active sport, which means... you're gonna sweat. So it's important that your feet don't stay wet for the whole match, right? The only dripping thing we want is our game! When we performed our smoke test in this Adidas pair, we thought its breathability would have improved compared to the previous version , yet... it remained the same. But that's not too bad, though. Both are still slightly more breathable than average! Your browser does not support the video tag. Adidas Trae Young 3 (3 out of 5) vs. Reebok Shaq Attaq (1 out of 5) As you can see in the video, its toebox is quite stuffy, and the one that lets the air go through is the tongue. Consequently, we decided to give this shoe a 3 out of 5 (where 5 is the maximum breathability). Once again, we didn't find it ideal for summer practices, especially if you play in an indoor court with low ventilation. But it does have a better airflow than most basketball pairs, so it can withstand warm-ish temperatures! In our second test regarding breathability, we put this player's upper against a bright light. In that way, we can see if it has any ventilation holes or pores to let the air in and out. Your browser does not support the video tag. Did you see any? Because we didn't! The light can only shine through the eyelets, which are fairly big but host the laces, and some holes in the tongue. The rest of the upper is tightly woven, and just in case you were wondering what on Earth that means, we've got a picture to explain it to you. See that? The fibers are so closely intertwined that there isn't even a small gap inbetween. Wanna have a closer look? If it wasn't for the tongue, this shoe would feel like a warm feet scarf for winter. It's okay to be a benchwarmer, but not a footwamer! Test results Trae Young 3 3 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Remember: The lower the platform, the more stable the shoes! During our games with these kicks, we felt that the motion control was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! No wobbly ankles, no unsteady steps, no unbalanced landings... just pure precision. Your browser does not support the video tag. This is one of our favourite parts about this pair. It lets you feel the court, and it makes you feel that you own it! More specifically, we loved it for in-n-outs, pump fakes, and any type of dribbling that required very precise or solid movements. Your browser does not support the video tag. In the previous video, you can see our feet performing a key point in an in-n-out. Check how stable our feet are, there was no slippage at all! Torsional rigidity In order to keep our feet stable, we need a solid structure that keeps them in place. Unlike pivots, who usually have slower and more \"you won't move me from my spot\" moves, point guards like Trae Young need to be fast. And as you might know, the faster you move, the more risk there is for your ankles to suffer some kind of injury! In order to protect you from that, the v3 of this lane holds an incredibly rigid upper. Your browser does not support the video tag. Just look at our thumbs... you can definitely tell we were trying our best to bend these baddies! But they didn't feel like cooperating. With a well-deserved 5 out of 5 in our torsional rigidity test, the Trae Young 3 is a trustworthy teammate that will keep your feet safe. Test results Trae Young 3 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness The heel follows the same path, as it focuses on keeping your feet right where they should be! Your browser does not support the video tag. With a 4 out of 5 in our heel counter stiffness test, you might think that this shoe is prone to heel rubbing. Even though this part might seem unforgiving, it's thickly padded, remember? So your heels will stay in place AND protected! We're loving this, Adidas! Test results Trae Young 3 4 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot If something is already great... why would you change it? That's what the brand decided after seeing how loved the midsole width in the forefoot of the previous version was! Once again at 122.2 mm, this pair can proudly say it accommodates wide feet! Test results Trae Young 3 122.2 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel But in the heel... the results were EVEN better! Surpassing its older sibling, our caliper showed 105.1 mm, which is also way wider than average! Remember we said before \"the lower the stack, the more stable the shoe\"? Well, let us add one more motto: \"The wider the midsole, the more stable the landings\"! We found this extremely convenient for our layups when the opposing team had a tough pivot or a solid defense, as the shoe kept us stable even if we landed after being slightly hit in the air. Test results Trae Young 3 105.1 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability Unlike the NBA players, who should be good at offense and defense, shoes can be bad at breathability but good at resistance. These two parameters are usually opposites, which means that, in most cases, if a shoe is highly breathable, its upper won't be very durable. To check this, we drilled the Trae Young 3's toebox for a good 12 seconds (half of a shot-clock violation, wow!) at a 5K RPM speed. Wanna see what happened? Your browser does not support the video tag. White material flying around like a ball hitting the very end of the rim! Getting a score of 3 out 5 for its toebox durability, we have to say that we were a bit disappointed. As this new version has the same breathability as the previous one, we did expect an upper just as durable (the Trae Young 2 scored a 5 out of 5 in this same test). We used the Reebok Shaq Attaq (which also scored a perfect 5/5) again to compare the resistance of each toebox to our Dremel. And just by looking at it, you can probably tell the Trae Young 3 got destroyed in this 1vs1... literally. Honestly, you should just stick to the Trae Young 2 if you want an okay-ish breathable but very durable pair. But if you're looking for something truly breathable and you don't mind \"helping the enemy team\" a little bit, the Nike Lebron Witness 7 is well-ventilated, slightly cheaper, and incredibly stylish! Test results Trae Young 3 3 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability In this sport, moves are usually aggressive and pretty fast: cuts, fakes, layups... Trae Young is an astounding player, but he shines specifically because of his offense. He's a strong attacker, so his shoes can't fall short! When we put this 3rd version on, we felt the heel was nicely padded and comfortable. Forget about annoying rubs or blisters, our feet were pretty happy even during our first game with it! But... we couldn't let it run away from our Dremel. Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see in the video, we put our tool not at the back, but right in the middle of the plushy sides of the heel. And... they performed just as badly as the upper. After only 4 seconds, we could see considerable wear. Still... we have seen worse! It does look dramatic in the picture, though. But as the heel is quite padded, our tool could not take all its comfort away. This made us give the Trae Young 3 another 3 out of 5 in our heel padding durability test. You might think that the padding looks just done after our test, needing a timeout badly. But have a look at the Reebok Answer DMX (on the left). It doesn't look that bad anymore, does it? This Reebok player wouldn't need to catch its breath during halftime... the game is already over for it! Test results Trae Young 3 3 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness Overall, we found this shoe's upper pretty comfortable, so... what about its outsole? Well, we can say that it does reflect Trae Young's hard game! When an outsole is hard, it usually means that it's ready to last. Let's see if our durometer agrees! And... it does! At 88.0 HC, this outsole is definitely harder than average! In other words, these kicks won't run away from you any time soon. As you know, Trae Young is also a fairly young player, so of course he would want something to walk his long basketball path along with him! Test results Trae Young 3 88.0 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability Alright, let's get down to our Dremel and its man-to-man... offense. Your browser does not support the video tag. After a 22-second attack at a high speed of 10K RPM, we measured a small 0.7 mm deep dent. Literally just a scratch, wow! This is where we start to see the improvement compared to the last version, as the damage was more than 2 times deeper! You might be wondering if this means that you can use this pair for outdoor basketball, right? Well, its outsole is indeed durable, we're not saying otherwise. Still... that's just not enough. We couldn't recommend it as a solid outdoor-ready option, but it will definitely be with you for a long time! If streetball is your thing, check any of these toughies out and show your neighbors how it's done! Test results Trae Young 3 0.7 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness Our caliper made sure we understood why taking these pals outside for a game was not a good idea. At 3.5 mm, its outsole thickness is below the average. This means that the amount of rubber protecting this shoe is slightly thinner compared to other pairs. Test results Trae Young 3 3.5 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness Once again, this shoe's insole is thinner than we expected if we take into account the Trae Young 3's overall weight. At 4.1 mm, it's just slightly lower than average, as it focuses on making sure you feel every part of the court under your feet. Test results Trae Young 3 4.1 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole You can change this shoe's insole and use your own orthotics, there's no problem! Remember we said its insole is quite thin? If you're looking for a plushier ride, you can just use another one. The whole platform is quite wide, so you shouldn't have any issues accommodating it! Test results Trae Young 3 Yes Reflective elements Nuh-uh, mate. You're the one shining in this pair, no reflective elements here! Test results Trae Young 3 No Tongue padding This shoe's tongue could be the MVP. Stylish, functional, helpful regarding breathability... and also not stuffy! At 3.7 mm, the Trae Young 3's tongue is WAY thinner than average. And when we say \"way\", we mean a whole 61%! Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see, this shoe is plush just in the right spots, so the fact that it doesn't have a massive tongue helps not to add more unnecessary weight, as it's already a heavy pair. Test results Trae Young 3 3.7 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type Unlike the previous version, which had a once-piece upper, this shoe has a both-sides gusseted tongue. We really liked this change. It doesn't only give the shoe a wider opening, it also helps with its breathability! Can you see the amount of holes it has? That's why all the smoke was coming through the tongue in our breathability test. So it does not only look cool, it's also very functional! It looks really pretty all tied up, doesn't it? And there's nothing better than defeating your enemies... with style . Test results Trae Young 3 Both sides (full) Heel tab We're loving the double game of a finger-loop at the heel AND at the top of the tongue! Once again, it's a functional and very nice detail that matches the minimalist vibe and clean style of these baddies. Test results Trae Young 3 Finger loop Trae Young 2 vs. 3 As we have already mentioned throughout the whole review, there have been multiple changes regarding the previous version of this basketball shoe. These are some key points that might help you make up your mind and stay with the v2, or go ahead and buy the v3: Both have an average breathability and heel padding durability of 3/5. The v2's toebox is way more durable than the v3's (5/5 vs. 2/5). The v3 has a harder and more durable outsole. Both are about the same weight. The v2 is 0.2 oz / 5 g lighter, but your feet won't notice the difference. The v2's midsole is way softer (11.5 HA vs. the v3's 22.5 HA). The v2 holds a secondary foam, but the v3 doesn't. Consequently, the ground feeling is better. Both are very rigid (5/5 in their torsional rigidity tests). The v2 got a lower score in our flex test, where we bent it to 90 degrees (31.4N vs. 40.8N). This means it's more flexible, so the ride is smoother. The v3 has a wider platform and pivoting area, so it's more stable. The v3 includes Adidas' Torsion System technology, and the v2 doesn't. The v2 features the Lightstrike cushioning technology and a BOOST midsole. The v2 has a sock-like fit that's very hard to put on, but the v3 has a more convenient traditional lacing system. The v3 is wider at the big toe, which makes it more comfortable for wide-feet / big-toed players.

This shoe still needs some break-in time. They are better off with the Nike KD 15 . Your browser does not support the video tag. Also, this shoe is also not durable enough for outdoor games. For hoopers who love to play in the open air, we advise you to go for the Nike Cosmic Unity 2 . The Nike LeBron 20: An amazing low-top We are amazed by the shoe's tremendous engineering that allowed it to be played like a mid or a high even though it's actually a true low-top. It is indeed one of the nicest LeBrons to come out. Your browser does not support the video tag. Breathability depends on the colorway In most colorways, the LeBron 20 comes with a traditional mesh upper. We don't have any issues regarding this fabric's breathability. However, Nike also released a couple of colorways that feature suede uppers. Your browser does not support the video tag. Nike LeBron 20 with suede upper (left) vs. Nike Giannis Immortality 2 (right) If you are prone to sweaty feet, we do not recommend the suede version. It only scored 2 out of 5 on our smoke breathability test (where 1 is the least breathable). Good thing, some air still passes through the tongue area. Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see, its solid upper has zero transparency. But the upside of such a beefy upper is, of course, its durability. Your browser does not support the video tag. Having applied a Dremel to the shoe's most sensitive upper part (front of the toebox) for 4 seconds at 10,000 RMPS, we only scratched the surface! Toe drags are a joke for this suede LeBron variation. In a typical mesh upper, the same force causes greater damage (most often, a hole). Mesh upper of the Nike Giannis Immortality 2 Enjoy a comfortable upper We feel that the shoe's lining is super padded and very comfortable. Your browser does not support the video tag. There is some padding in the tongue as well. We measured its thickness at 6.3 mm. But it is not as beefy as in some other basketball shoes (i.e. take the 12.9-mm tongue of the PUMA TRC Blaze Court ). The average tongue thickness for basketball shoes is 9.5 mm. A grip that has everything covered In terms of traction, we regard LeBron 20 as top-tier because it stuck like glue even on dusty surfaces. We can attest that the non-uniform pattern on the outsole helps the shoe grab the floor in a lot of different directions. Your browser does not support the video tag. Due to the shoe's multidirectional bite and really supportive structure, we were able to achieve and maintain high speeds, making the shoe tremendously nimble. Can be used outdoor We found LeBron 20 in indoor use awesome but when it comes to outdoor games from time to time, it is also excellent. In our durability tests, we actually found that the Nike LeBron 20 could work for occasional outdoor use. The thickness of its rubber outsole (3.7 mm) is right at the average of basketball shoes (3.8 mm). Disclaimer: We take four measurements with the durometer and calculate the average to come up with the final result. The photo above shows one of the measurements. And when measuring the density of this rubber compound with a durometer, we found that the LeBron 20 is 4% firmer than average. Harder rubbers are less prone to fast abrasion compared to softer ones. This is another reason why this Nike shoe may not wear out that fast on an outdoor court. Enjoy plush cushioning with the Nike LeBron 20 The midsole tooling is definitely soft. We realized that it's soft enough to ensure comfort but firm enough not to flat out quite easily. With this, we concluded that the LeBron 20's cushioning system is really meant for a lot of contours and a lot of comfort. Your browser does not support the video tag. Our lab tests totally confirm our sentiments. Having measured the shoe's foam in the heel with a durometer, we can state that the Lebron 20 is 7% softer than the average. It is not a marshmallow by any means but it is softer than the Cosmic Unity 2 , for instance. There's a lot of energy return The midsole tooling is also able to deliver a lot of energy return. Our in-game experiences in its midsole are super bouncy. As for the amount of cushioning, it can be said that the Nike LeBron 20 sits right at the average of basketball shoes. There is 27.0 mm of stack height in the heel, compared to the average 28.2 mm. In the forefoot, our calipers show 22.6 mm, compared to the average 21.0 mm. Disclaimer: We always measure stack height with the insole included. In the Nike LeBron 20, we measured the insole at 4.0 mm in the heel area. This leaves us with a heel-to-toe drop of 4.4 mm, which is lower than the average 7.2 mm. A lower drop combined with an average cushioning height translates to a more stable and grounded shoe. Court feel is not forgotten There is a Zoom unit in the forefoot, and it brings us more ground feel to that area. This enhances our control and confidence for shifty footwork and agility. Your browser does not support the video tag. A sense of stability is also provided by the fairly wide footprint. We measured the widest parts of the shoe's forefoot (111.7 mm) and the heel (90.6 mm). While this is not wider than average, it provides a reliable base for all of your court movements. The shoe is on the stiffer side Another key factor that contributes to stability is the overall stiffness of the Nike LeBron 20. Your browser does not support the video tag. Twisting and bending the shoe in a manual assessment, we rated both its longitudinal and torsional flexibility as 5 out of 5 (maximum stiffness level). Your browser does not support the video tag. However, when we bent the shoe to a 90-degree angle and measured its resistance with a gauge, it turned out to be of average flexibility for a basketball shoe. It is even 3% bendier than average. Yet, it is still stiffer than some of the other Nike shoes we've tested. Snug fit: Take it or make adjustments We consider the fit of the Nike LeBron 20 incredibly tapered, especially around the forefoot. Those with narrow and medium-sized feet can go true to size if they want a snug, one-to-one fit. Otherwise, going up half a size is what we recommend. Indeed, the toebox of the Nike LeBron 20 tapers more compared to other basketball shoes we've tested. We measure both the widest part of the forefoot and the area around the toes. On average, our lab-tested basketball shoes get 29% narrower towards the toes, while the LeBron gets 33.2% narrower. We are certain that players with wider feet are going to feel it. Especially in the suede variant, which doesn't have any stretch to it. Lockdown: Not a problem with the LeBron 20 Even when we do incredibly violent movements while wearing LeBron 20, this basketball shoe offers superb lockdown and containing. We discovered that the semi-gusseted tongue is there to prevent the foot from sliding. Heel slips are out of the question as well given the shoe's stiff heel counter. In a manual assessment, we rated it as 4 out of 5 (where 5 is the stiffest). Your browser does not support the video tag. LeBron 20: Pretty on and off the court The 20th Nike LeBron also looks fantastic. There is no doubt that it can catch the attention of on-lookers. Indeed, we snatched hearts while sporting this shoe in the courts and on the streets.

Hustle 2 Nike G.T. Hustle 2 review Dimitrije Curcic on Jun 17, 2024 | Reviewed using methodology 1.7 Our verdict Aptly named, the Nike G.T. Hustle 2 is meant for light players whose playing style involves a lot of running on the court. Our playtests confirmed that the shoe inherits the fast-moving personality of its predecessor, the G.T. Run. Exceptionally light, minimal, and responsive, the Hustle 2 is fun to play in if you want to lose the stiffness and bulkiness of most hoop shoes these days. We loved the natural movement and court connection that this Nike shoe has to offer. Top pick in best low top Nike basketball shoes (2024) Pros Very light and speedy on foot Unmatched court feel Grounded and responsive midsole Highly flexible and smooth-feeling Great traction on clean courts Stable for non-aggressive movements True to size, one-to-one fit Cons Not for outdoor play Very little support Minimal impact protection Audience verdict 86 Good!

Hustle 2 must be on your radar if: you are a light basketball player in search of a minimal shoe for sprinting up and down the court you seek lightness and flexibility in your next pair of hoop shoes you prefer a grounded, low-profile platform Who should NOT buy In our opinion, there are a few reasons why the G.T. Hustle 2 may not meet your needs on the court. First of all, if you're a heavier player, you will need more impact protection and support. We recommend looking into the Nike LeBron NXXT GEN as an alternative. It also offers the benefit of better traction and is more outdoor-ready. Your browser does not support the video tag. If you are not ready to pay $170 for a minimal shoe that doesn't even have a shank, consider the Nike Ja 1 or the Nike Giannis Freak 5. Cushioning Heel stack The G.T. Hustle 2 also stands out as the least cushioned shoe in our basketball roster. Measuring its stack height in the heel, we were amazed to see as little as 23.6 mm on our caliper! It is by far the lowest hoop shoe in our lab along with the Nike Sabrina 1 ( 23.7 mm ). Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can probably guess, this Nike shoe offers very little impact protection, especially if you are a big guy! But in return, the G.T. Hustle 2 offers the most speedy setup for light and nimble players who sprint from baseline to baseline. Test results G.T. Hustle 2 23.6 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack Just like we expected, the forefoot stack of the Hustle 2 is some of the lowest in the industry, showing only 18.2 mm on the caliper. If you enjoy a more intimate court feel, there is nothing more grounded than the Nike G.T. Hustle 2 (as of today). Test results G.T. Hustle 2 18.2 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop A lower-than-average drop was also expected in this Nike basketball shoe. The height difference between the shoe's heel and forefoot stacks comes in at only 5.4 mm which is a bit lower than the average. This setup encourages a flatter and thus more natural foot position in which the heel sits only a few millimeters higher than the toes. It feels less cushy and supportive than the higher drop but promotes a more planted experience in return. Test results G.T. Hustle 2 5.4 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. Having sliced the Nike G.T. Hustle 2 in half, we discovered that its cushioning setup is very similar to that of the Air Jordan XXXVIII . There is a full-length Zoom Air Strobel sitting on top of a full-length foam layer. We are almost 100% sure that the shoe uses Cushlon foam because the compound is on the soft side and feels quite responsive. Your browser does not support the video tag. Pressing our Shore A durometer against it returned 21.0 HA which is 22% softer than the industry average. However, you don't get to feel this plushness to the fullest because the foam is sandwiched between hard rubber and a firmer Zoom Air unit. But overall, the G.T. Hustle 2 provides an immensely responsive ride that promotes speed above all else. Test results G.T. Hustle 2 21.0 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Nike G.T. Hustle 2 fits true to size (63 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit Trying the Nike G.T. Hustle 2 in our regular men's US size 9, we were very happy with its one-to-one fit. There was no pinching or pressure on the sides of our feet. Applying our caliper to the widest part of the shoe's toebox, we got 100.3 mm which is consistent with the other hoop shoes in the same size. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results G.T. Hustle 2 100.3 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width The shoe has a minor tapering towards the toes but it doesn't get narrower than the average. Our caliper showed a standard width of 76.3 mm around the big toe. In case you're wondering, the shoe's mesh toebox has absolutely no give to it. Don't expect the material to stretch out after a break-in. Your browser does not support the video tag. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results G.T. Hustle 2 76.3 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Lacing For the most part, we found it easy to deal with the shoe's flat laces. Our only concern is that you might want to double-knot them for longer games because they seem a little slippery. In addition, the shoe offers two reinforced eyelets on the collar to give you the option of tying a runner's knot and getting the most out of the lockdown. Flexibility / Stiffness Very few basketball shoes can boast flexibility these days, which makes the Nike G.T. Hustle 2 a white crow in this department. Your browser does not support the video tag. Packing no shank in the midsole, it took much less effort to bend the Hustle 2 to a 90-degree angle in our stiffness test. With a force gauge reading of only 28.9N, it is 40% more flexible than a typical hoop shoe. This Nike shoe treated us to buttery smooth heel-to-toe transitions with its easy flex and consistent cushioning. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results G.T. Hustle 2 28.9N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight Positioned as a super nimble shoe for sprinting up and down the court, the Nike G.T. Hustle 2 lives up to the marketing 100%! We are happy to report that it proved to be some of the lightest basketball shoes in our lab. Clocking in at 12.0 oz (340g) in a men's US size 9, it is two ounces lighter than the average hoop shoe. Its weightlessness, minimal cushioning, and streamlined upper made us feel at full speed during the playtest. Test results G.T. Hustle 2 12.0 oz (340g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability With its minimal upper, mesh panels, and ventilation pores on the tongue, the Nike G.T. Hustle 2 offers pretty decent breathability. Your browser does not support the video tag. Look how swiftly the smoke escaped through the shoe's upper in the tongue area! Your browser does not support the video tag. We are not surprised that this is the shoe's most ventilated area given the many airflow channels the tongue. We were hoping that the toebox mesh would enhance the shoe's breathability but the lens of our microscope shows how super densely woven it is. Not much hope for the airflow here. Assessing the G.T. Hustle 2's overall breathability, we gave it a lower-than-average score of 2. Test results G.T. Hustle 2 2 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Even though stability is not this Nike shoe's forte, we are happy to say that it doesn't lack inherent stability as a minimalist shoe. Your browser does not support the video tag. Its low-to-the-ground profile creates enough steadiness to provide balance for quick movements on the court. It is not the best option for super forceful cuts but is nice enough for light players with agile footwork. But even if the unfortunate ankle roll does occur, the shoe's platform is low enough to prevent the worst-case scenario. Torsional rigidity The G.T. Hustle 2's midsole comes without a stabilizing shank but its full-length Zoom Air unit and high midsole topline generate enough stiffness to provide essential stability. Your browser does not support the video tag. We rated the shoe's torsional rigidity with a pretty high score of 4 out of 5 in our manual test. Sure, it's a bit lower than the average of basketball shoes but we can't complain considering the intention behind its design. Test results G.T. Hustle 2 4 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness Please do keep in mind that the Hustle 2 also has little to no ankle support and a pretty weak rearfoot hold. We don't mean heel slippage but the lack of a structured heel counter that would create a barricade-like effect around the ankle. Your browser does not support the video tag. Assessing the shoe's heel counter stiffness in our manual test, we couldn't rate it any higher than 3 out of 5. It is notably more pliable than the average. Test results G.T. Hustle 2 3 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot Another component that helps the G.T. Hustle 2 feel inherently stable is the lateral outrigger in the forefoot. The widest part of the shoe's sole showed 116.5 mm on our caliper. That's even a couple of millimeters wider than average! Your browser does not support the video tag. It's great that the shoe's forefoot stability helps to compensate for the lack of rearfoot support. Test results G.T. Hustle 2 116.5 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel Looking at the width of the shoe's heel also confirmed that the G.T. Hustle 2 is best for players who mostly stay on their toes. Our caliper measured 84.6 mm in the widest part of the heel which is almost 6 mm narrower than the average. Not the most stable landing area. Test results G.T. Hustle 2 84.6 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability Compared to a typical basketball shoe, the G.T. Hustle 2 has a very minimal upper design with practically no reinforcements. The shoe features a large mesh panel on top of the toebox which feels pretty frail to the touch. And as our Dremel test shows, it is very much prone to wear and tear. Your browser does not support the video tag. The fabric threads tore within seconds of touching them with our Dremel's sandpaper tip. And the damage we saw was notably greater than what we usually see in the lab. Thus, we rated the shoe's toebox durability with a lower-than-average score of 3 out of 5. Test results G.T. Hustle 2 3 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability Gladly, the textile used for the shoe's inner lining proved to be much more resilient. Your browser does not support the video tag. Its smooth nature stood up to the sandpaper looking almost as good as new after the 4-second test. Thus, we readily rated its durability with a high score of 4. Test results G.T. Hustle 2 4 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness Despite looking like gummy bears, the rubber pimples on the shoe's outsole are actually pretty hard. Our Shore C durometer returned a higher-than-average reading of 87.5 HC as we pressed it against one of the knobs. This is a very promising start. Test results G.T. Hustle 2 87.5 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability We went on to test the abrasion resistance of these pimples with a high Dremel speed of 10K RPM. Your browser does not support the video tag. But after 22 seconds of exposure, the rubber didn't give in more than 0.5 mm! That's even shallower than average! So if you've never dealt with translucent rubber before, we hope this test assures you of its hard-wearing characteristics. Test results G.T. Hustle 2 0.5 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness Last but not least, the shoe also uses a sufficiently thick rubber layer for the outsole. Measuring its thickness with a caliper retrieved a solid reading of 4.4 mm. So, with all that said, does the Nike G.T. Hustle 2 make a great option for outdoor basketball courts? Unfortunately, we don't think so. We are concerned about the protruding rubber knobs as their shape makes them more prone to wearing out on hard outdoor surfaces. An occasional game most likely won't do a great deal of damage but we can't recommend this Nike shoe for regular outdoor use. Test results G.T. Hustle 2 4.4 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness To make sure your foot has enough buffer from the thin midsole and the firm Zoom Air Strobel, the shoe adds a well-padded insole. It has a slightly higher than-average thickness of 5.3 mm based on our caliper measurement. Test results G.T. Hustle 2 5.3 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole You can always replace the stick insole of this Nike basketball shoe with your own orthotics if that's what you prefer. Test results G.T. Hustle 2 Yes Tongue padding The shoe's tongue is moderately padded with foam, showing 7.0 mm of thickness at the topmost part (where the lace pressure is usually the greatest). Even though it is a couple of millimeters thinner than average, it got the job done beautifully. Test results G.T. Hustle 2 7.0 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type We experienced a nice and secure foot containment inside the Nike G.T.

The KD 16 came to our lab with one thing in mind: make our performance and confidence on the court reach new levels thanks to its incredible lookdown and supportiveness. Its padded and comfortable interiors just made the whole experience even better, blessing us with a comfortable ride. We felt its snappy forefoot give us an extra boost of energy every time we went for aggressive moves. And its lightweight nature let us go for more advanced dribbling or footwork with ease. We loved its fashionable design so much that this hoop could easily conquer the streets. Just don't take it out in the summer, or else your feet will have the works pool party ever: sweat, sweat, and more sweat! Pros Incredibly good lockdown feel Supportive and stable structure Responsive and snappy forefoot Very padded and comfortable Lighter than average Nice court feel Cool reflective elements Fashionable design Full of details Cons Not breathable at all Not for those with wide feet Outsole needs to be broken in Audience verdict 86 Good!

You're a guard or a player with a quick and strong playstyle that needs something kind of light. Stability in footwear is one of your priorities. You're looking for a new pal to boost your confidence: style and performance-wise. You need a comfortable shoe that lets you feel the court under your feet. Who should not buy Even though we fell in love with this shoe's style and we'd definitely wear it to walk around, we decided this was not such a good idea after our wear tests in the summer. These Nike's padding boosted its comfort levels, but it also made it an incredibly warm pair. If you're looking for something breathable, the Under Armour Curry 10 might be a better option. Its features are similar to the KD 16's, and it's also in the same price range! Your browser does not support the video tag. If you want a shoe from an iconic player but you need it to be wide-feet friendly, then you should have a look at the Jordan Luka 2 , which is pretty similar. If you're just looking for an all-rounder and you're not going to play outside, then the Nike LeBron 20 is our recommended option. The only thing that we need to warn you about is that it has to be broken in. Cushioning Heel stack At 27.4 mm, this shoe's heel stack is a bit lower than average. This allowed us to be closer to the ground, which also led to more precise and controlled moves. We believe this type of heel stack favors quick players, like guards. Centers usually need shoes with a higher and cushioned sole, as they tend to be bigger and constantly jump for rebounds. What's more, the KD 16 includes a lightweight Air Strobel at the back. This lovely extra detail improves the shoe's overall cushioning and comfort, which is always great news! Taking into account its lower-than-average weight, we really couldn't be any happier. Test results KD 16 27.4 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack Surprisingly, the forefoot stack is slightly higher than average at 23.4 mm. Honestly, we did feel this on our feet during our wear tests. We played for hours with these hoops on, and we found them really comfortable. What we liked the most about it, is that whenever we landed on our forefoot, the impact was not as harsh on our ball of the foot as it was with other models. Your browser does not support the video tag. We'll talk about this later on, but can you see there's a different colour there in the midsole? If you look at the picture, from the bottom to the top of the sole, you can see a bright orange layer, and then some mixed foam, light grey and dark grey. Can you guess what those things are before we tell you? Test results KD 16 23.4 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop There wasn't a big difference between the heel and the forefoot stacks, so we didn't expect a high drop; and we were totally right. At 4.0 mm, this shoe's drop is way lower than average! You can see it in the picture: even though the middle of the sole is a bit higher, the heel and the forefoot are lower and yet pretty close in height! The midsole structure is pretty clear in this picture, so we're gonna use it to explain it. There's a full-length cushlon bed, which is the darkest material. As we've mentioned before, there's also an Air Strobel in the rearfoot, focusing on comfort. This is the bubble-like piece you can see at the back. Between the full-length gray layer (insole) and the bright red layer (shank) we can see a light gray piece in the forefoot. That's our beloved Zoom Air unit, which offers some extra cushioning. The bright red piece, known as shank, goes from the midfoot up to the toes. It provides your ride with a nice snap. Test results KD 16 4.0 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. This model is not designed specifically for centers, as KD isn't one of them! At 28.5 HA, our durometer told us this shoe's midsole softness is close to the average. We can't say it's super plush, as our feet and data would disagree, but it felt really comfortable. Your browser does not support the video tag. If you're looking for a plusher model and you don't mind it being on the heavier side, have a look at the Nike LeBron 20 ; it's crazy popular for a reason! Centers love it, and its design is also suitable for more agile players! Test results KD 16 28.5 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Nike KD 16 fits true to size (72 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit If you're a Nike fan as much as you are a basketball lover, by now you're probably familiar with the fact this brand tends to make narrow shoes. But we want facts! And our caliper is ready to spit some. At 105.4 mm, this model's toebox width at the widest part is wider than average, but not enough for us to categorise this shoe as wide-feet friendly. Keep reading to find out why! This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results KD 16 105.4 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width At 79.7 mm, our average-sized feet were happy to have some extra room. As the KD 16 doesn't have an extra protective layer in the toebox, it felt less restrictive on the sides compared to the previous version . This is something we really appreciated during our games. Nevertheless, even though this KD is wider than the previous iteration at the ball of the foot, we still can't recommend it to wide-foot hooperhollics. It tapers quite aggressively towards the toecap, so big toes might feel cramped. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results KD 16 79.7 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Flexibility / Stiffness The whole shoe is pretty stable and supportive, and we've already mentioned it's also well-structured, right? Our gauge showing 55.3N didn't really surprise us, honestly! Our feet could tell the same story as this tool. Your browser does not support the video tag. Consequently, our heel-to-toe transitions were not incredibly smooth. But they weren't that bad either! This was due to the stiff piece under the arch that we discovered in our lab. So, anyway, this was the price to pay for our feet to always feel safe and sound, and we happily did! Our confidence boost with these Nikes skyrocketed as much as our performance with them. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results KD 16 55.3N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight After analysing the results of our previous tests, we expected this shoe to be quite heavy. But wait a second... Kevin Durant is currently playing as a small forward ('23-'24 season). So he definitely needs something light on his feet, right? Plus, the KD 15 was already lighter than average. Also, during our wear tests, we LOVED the feel of this shoe! It didn't drag our feet down, and even though its outsole is ready to last, we didn't think it was bottom-heavy at all. We felt connected to the court and ready to perform any move, with or without the ball. When theory goes one way and practice goes another, we can only rely on facts! Alright, scale, tell us the truth about this: At 13.9 oz (394.0g), this shoe's weight has stayed consistent compared to its predecessors. As it was not an aspect where it had to improve, we were pretty happy about it! We were really happy to see this, which went in line with how we felt during our wear tests. That's why we believe it's so important to perform lab and wear tests, we need the best of both worlds to be as precise as we can with our reviews. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results KD 16 13.9 oz (394g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability You've most likely played basketball before, right? Whether it was at school, a summer evening with friends, as a kid in the park or even professionally, you'll be aware of this sport being very physically demanding. So, yeah, you end up sweating! And with sweating we mean really sweating, like... everywhere . There are some parts of your body that will definitely sweat no matter what you do. But regarding your feet, breathable hoopers might make this experience more pleasant. That's why we grabbed the KD16 and smoked things up, check this out! Your browser does not support the video tag. On the right, the Under Armour Curry Flow 10 , which scored a 5/5 on our breathability test, is definitely a master of ventilation. On the left, this Nike... is barely a pupil in training. It didn't even let much smoke out overall, so we couldn't give it more than a sad 1/5. Its materials might explain why, so let's dive into that. We can clearly see a thick chained pattern with a black layer underneath. This structure is typically used to reinforce the shoe's durability, so hopefully it pays off on our next test! Yeah, there's no way the air could easily go through this structure. We can't actually see any ventilation wholes, as every opening of the chain is carefully covered by the black second layer. We were a bit surprised, as this model got a lower score on breathability compared to its predecessor, the Nike KD 15 (2/5). We thought the brand might have wanted to improve, or at least keep that ventilation level. So let's find out which other changes this latest version has in store! Test results KD 16 1 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Basketball shoes need to be stable. Just think about all the quick and deep moves your ankles go for, even when you're so into the game that you don't even notice them! We trusted in the KD 16 to keep our ankles safe and sound, and it responded accordingly! Your browser does not support the video tag. You can see it in the video above, this model will take care of your joints in the best way it can. But that wasn't enough for us. Yeah, its lateral stability seemed pretty good when we were standing; so... what about performing a riskier move? We're here to try every single aspect of these hoopers, so we went all in once again! Your browser does not support the video tag. This move is called backdoor cut, and if you've read any other basketball reviews of ours, you've definitely seen us performing it (check the Adidas Dame Certified ). Why? Well, because it speaks volumes regarding a shoe's stability and grip. In the KD 16 case, you can see its grip and stability are totally on point. Torsional rigidity Even though the upper materials of this shoe are not the most durable, they're definitely well-structured. This might sound contradictory to you, so please have a look at this video of us struggling to make this model bend: Your browser does not support the video tag. Actually... we can't even say it did bend with our feet either! It's a very comfortable shoe, but its whole structure is ready to support your moves instead of bending along them. This made us feel safe and ready to risk it all on the court. Also, when we cut the shoe in half, remember we could see some pieces in the sole? In the forefoot, that was a snappy Zoom Air Unit to keep you playing for hours on end. This also helped the cushioning level up its comfort and responsiveness, as well as our game when we decided to test our limits. Test results KD 16 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness With a 4 out of 5 in our heel counter stiffness, this shoe made sure your heel didn't move an inch. Nice one, Nike! Your browser does not support the video tag. We also fell head over heels in love with its whole aesthetic and the metallic details at the back, which create some contrast with the tiger-like red and black pattern. Gotta be fierce in the court, though! Test results KD 16 4 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot There's been a big change regarding the midsole width if we compare this new iteration with the previous one. At 116.0 mm, our caliper has made it clear: the KD 16 definitely beats the 15 regarding stability! Test results KD 16 116.0 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The 85.9 mm our caliper showed when we measured the midsole's width in the heel felt okay in our average width feet. Nevertheless, this narrower fit means the shoe definitely needs a bit of time to break it. Test results KD 16 85.9 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability After performing our breathability test, we assumed this shoe's upper would be pretty durable. But hey, we're not here to make theories... we're here to prove them! That's how RunRepeat works. So, let's grab our Dremel and see what's up. Your browser does not support the video tag. The beginning didn't look very promising, as we could already see some material rolling around the tool. Yet, when we lifted the Dremel, we nodded contently. It was not that bad! This was the result: a messed up top layer material. But hey, it could be way worse! The video looked a little bit dramatic, we'll give you that, but it's all to keep the spark alive! Let us show you what a really messed up upper looks like: We used another Under Armour shoe to compare it with. And... with a devastating 1/5, now our Nike's 3/5 score in our toebox durability test doesn't sound as bad anymore, right? Test results KD 16 3 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability Jumps, cuts, sprints, backdoor cuts, dribbles, pump fakes... no matter what your best move or which position you play, you need your shoes to resist the constant running of your feet against it. That's why the heel padding durability test is so important! Imagine buying your dream pair and then finding out its heel won't last even a couple of games... no, thank you! Your browser does not support the video tag. Our Dremel gave us a hand (and a rolling one, indeed) and we checked this shoe's heel padding durability. We were really happy with the results, as this part proved to be pretty wear resistant earning a well-deserved 4/5! Not bad at all, huh? Just showing as much resistance to any rivals as the own Kevin Durant! The Under Armour Charged Assert 9 definitely wanted to run away as soon as it saw our Dremel, look at that! Not only the lining, but also the padding got completely owned (1/5 score). A 2vs1 that resulted in a strepitous win for our tool, no doubt! Test results KD 16 4 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness At 76.9 HC, our durometer is telling us this shoe's outsole is slightly less hard than average. Following such result, we wouldn't recommend the use of this model to play outdoors. Yeah, it could last a couple of games, but its outsole would definitely be the one bearing the burnt. In summary: stay inside! Test results KD 16 76.9 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability It's true that there are many times when some conclusions lead to others. For example, if a shoe is super breathable, it usually isn't very durable. But a model swimming upstream in comparison with its pal is what makes our lab reviews magical! Your browser does not support the video tag. As in this test we target a different material, we speed our Dremel up (10K RPM) and go for a longer attack (22 seconds long). We could clearly see that the rubber didn't really mind our tool trying to break it all down. Can you see the dent? On the right, next to the edge. Yeah, we know, it's harder than finding Wally! Even though the result was better than average, as the damage is only 0.7 mm deep, we still recommend you use this pair only for your indoor games. There's still a fair amount of material until the bottom of the shoe is reached, that's true. But that's not the only thing that matters. For example, check the outsole's pattern. With so many shapes and lines, pebbles would absolutely find a comfortable new home in your shoes! Test results KD 16 0.7 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness At 4.6 mm, our caliper is happily telling us that this shoe's outsole is thicker than average. But, you see... this shoe's outsole material is not as hard as the average for its category, yet it showed incredible durability. That's why we think the brand could have gone for a thinner outsole. Not much, maybe just a little bit more closer to the average! Still, this decision is probably the brand's response to the softer outsole. Let us break it down for you: A very hard outsole needs less material, as it's naturally more durable. This means that you get more ground feel and that the bottom of your shoe will last longer. A very soft outsole needs more material, as it should typically be less durable. This means your shoe might be heavier, but a bigger layer is needed in order to protect its integrity. In this case, we got the wonderful harder than average material + thicker than average outsole combination! It's not something we see every day in our lab, we definitely loved it. Your browser does not support the video tag. On another topic, after our wear tests, we were pretty happy with its grip (spoiler alert!) as we tried it outside and inside. Even though these pictures are from an outside court, don't worry, we tested the shoe on both surfaces. That's why we can tell you that it's better to keep it for indoor courts, but that it can last a couple of games fighting the abrasive outdoor courts too. Test results KD 16 4.6 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness After our caliper reading we understood why this hooper pal is so comfy. With a measurement of 5.8 mm, its insole is definitely thicker than average. This helped levelling up the overall comfort of the shoe. And if you don't trust us, trust our feet... it was wonderful! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results KD 16 5.8 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole A removable insole is always a plus! We really liked this shoe's insole... and no, it wasn't just because of the awesome Slim Reaper detail! (Even though that actually made us open our mouths in awe). But if you need to wear your own orthotics, don't worry, this model will make it easy! Test results KD 16 Yes Reflective elements Even though this model is not crazy expensive, it does have some expensive vibe details that made us thank Nike a thousand times. One of those are the reflective elements the brand included, check them out! Your browser does not support the video tag. Shine as bright as the very own Slim Reaper with these! Test results KD 16 Yes Tongue padding To keep your feet not only where they should be, but also comfortable, Nike has decided to level up once again its game in this super hoopers. At 11.1 mm, our caliper happily told us that this shoe's tongue is more padded than average. Overall, the KD 16's fit was comfortably snug in our standard-width feet thanks to its padded interior. Look! Your browser does not support the video tag. Even though it's not a breathable shoe (don't forget it scored a 1/5 in our breathability test), its padded interiors make sure your feet are warm, comfortable, and right where they should be. No weird movements + No wobbling = No worries! Test results KD 16 11.1 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type This shoe's tongue is fully gusseted, and we loved it. But just saying it's gusseted is not enough for us. We want to make sure it actually helps our feet stay in the right place. That's why it's so important to wear-test every model! And that's what we do here, in RunRepeat. Because of our games with this shoe on, we can tell you that regarding lockdown feel and foot containment... IT. IS. A. BEAST. We didn't experience any kind of heel slippage or any other weird move from our feet. It also showed wonderful stability when we went for backdoor cuts (as we previously stated) and any other in-n-out aggressive moves. This feeling of safety did not only come from the gussets and the small loop in the middle of the tongue of this shoe, which kept it from dancing around, but also from its lacing system. As you can see in the picture, the laces go through a lateral wall that made sure our midfoot was tightly embraced, hugging it as much as we needed depending on how tight we tied the shoe up. This detail made the KD 16's lockdown level up, and we couldn't be happier. Test results KD 16 Both sides (full) Heel tab The KD 15 has a big finger loop at the back, but it also has a semi-gusseted tongue! On the other hand, the KD 16 doesn't have any kind of heel tab, yet putting it on is pretty easy thanks to its non-gusseted tongue. To sum up, what we mean is that we didn't really feel like something was missing, as the shoe was pretty easy to put on and off. Also, we are absolutely IN LOVE with the Slim Reaper detail at the back, right next to the metallic winged Swooshes. Kevin Durant is cool, but his shoes might be even cooler!

For them, we recommend the Lebron NXXT GEN - a little pricier but has a perfect balance of impact protection and court feel. Your browser does not support the video tag. Being a more affordable option, the LeBron Witness compromised its upper durability. But we've seen even cheaper hoop shoes that did better with abrasion resistance like the Nike Air Max Impact 4 and the UA Lockdown 6 . Cushioning Heel stack It's pretty impressive that this Nike shoe keeps the weight low despite its massive stack height. We used a caliper to measure the shoe's heel height and it returned a whopping 34.1 mm! This is by far the tallest shoe in our catalog! This is primarily due to the large Max Air unit embedded into the midsole. On the court, this Lebron Witness shoe offers top-notch impact protection. All the shock coming from our aggressive heel strikes and harsh landings was sufficiently absorbed, leaving our feet and legs free from pain all throughout the playtest. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Lebron Witness 7 34.1 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack The shoe's forefoot is just as generously cushioned. With a caliper measurement of 25.2 mm, this Lebron shoe is a few millimeters taller than average. Getting up on the toes in this shoe feels very supportive thanks to the forefoot Max Air. Test results Lebron Witness 7 25.2 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop It also turns out that the LeBron Witness 7 has a higher-than-average drop of 9 mm. This is a couple of millimeters higher than the average 7 mm. The Max Air unit elevates the heel a little more to maximize protection for those heel-dominant strikes. Just like all LeBron shoes, it makes for an excellent option for centers. Test results Lebron Witness 7 8.9 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. The primary cushioning foam of the LeBron Witness 7 feels a little of the firm side. Our durometer shows a reading of 30.3 HA, which is 9% firmer than average. We found that the firm nature of foam helps to make the platform more stable in lieu of its tall stack height. Test results Lebron Witness 7 30.3 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Secondary foam softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. On the other hand, the foam layer underneath the Max Air unit is very plush. It creates space for bounce by being extra squishy. Your browser does not support the video tag. We measured the foam to be as soft as 14.1 HA! That's a whole 115% plusher than the primary cushioning. As a result, the shoe feels perfectly balanced underfoot. Test results Lebron Witness 7 14.1 HA Average 27.8 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Size and fit Size Nike Lebron Witness 7 fits slightly small (62 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit With the soft and slightly stretchy nature of the upper material, it feels like this Nike shoe offers a little more wiggle room. In the widest part of the forefoot, we measured the Witness 7 at 103.1 mm - that's about 3 mm wider than average! This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Lebron Witness 7 103.1 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width Repeating the measurement in the shoe's big-toe area, however, we got 76.5 mm - this is the same width as the average. It indicates that the toebox doesn't taper more than usual in this shoe. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Lebron Witness 7 76.5 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Flexibility / Stiffness When it comes to the shoe's stiffness, the LeBron Witness 7 is not that much different from the rest of our tested basketball shoes. It took about as much force to bend the shoe to a 90-degree angle as it takes on average. Our force gauge shows that it required 38.8N, only 8% less than the average. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Lebron Witness 7 38.8N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight Given that the average weight of LeBron basketball shoes hovers around 14.3 oz (406g), the Lebron Witness 7 is among the lightest in the series. But it's not the lightest compared to other brands. Tipping the scales at 13.7 oz (387g), the shoe weighs the same as the average of all our lab-tested hoop shoes. Test results Lebron Witness 7 13.7 oz (387g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability The Lebron Witness 7 beats breathability records among our lab-tested basketball shoes! Featuring soft materials, the shoe's upper allowed a good deal of smoke to pass through in our smoke-pumping test. Not only did the smoke get through the tongue and eyelets, but also seeped through the toebox itself. That rarely happens in hoop shoes. The shoe gets a high score of 4 out of 5 for breathability. Your browser does not support the video tag. Looking at the toebox fabric through a microscope, we can see that it is tightly woven and yet much more porous than most upper materials. Test results Lebron Witness 7 4 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Nike made sure to throw a whole bunch of supportive overlays onto the shoe to really level up its stability. Your browser does not support the video tag. Overall, we think that the brand succeeded. But if you are an agile and super shifty player, you may want more support around the forefoot. We found that the material was a little too soft to hold the foot in place. Your browser does not support the video tag. For a firmer foothold, consider the LeBron NXXT GEN . Torsional rigidity The platform is rock-solid in the LeBron Witness 7. Attempting to twist the shoe with our hands revealed that it is exceptionally stiff. We rated its torsional rigidity with the highest score of 5/5. According to Nike, it's the Max Air unit that's responsible for the shoe's lateral stability and it also \"helps harness and direct your force.\" Test results Lebron Witness 7 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness The shoe's heel lockdown is very much on point too. We never had to worry about wobbling or heel slippage while wearing the shoe. Test results Lebron Witness 7 4 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot The shoe's base is not the widest out there but it does its job well. However, if you are someone who relies heavily on those outriggers on the side, this is not the right shoe. Measuring the widest part of the forefoot, we got 110.5 mm - a little narrower than average. Test results Lebron Witness 7 110.5 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel In the widest part of the heel, we also found it to be a few millimeters narrower than average at 86.3 mm. Test results Lebron Witness 7 86.3 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability But there is a big downside to all that airy softness. It's a total lack of wear resistance. The toebox material failed to hold up to our 12-second Dremel test which resulted in a large see-through tear. On a 1-5 scale where 5 is the most durable, we rated the shoe as low as 1. Your browser does not support the video tag. For comparison, the woven upper of the Nike Cosmic Unity 3 did significantly better in the same conditions. But to be fair, it also costs $65 more than the Witness 7. Test results Lebron Witness 7 1 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability The shoe's plush and cozy heel padding performed just as badly. After only 4 seconds of holding the Dremel against it, we saw considerable wear. Your browser does not support the video tag. We had to rate this Nike shoe with yet another low score - 1 out of 5. Test results Lebron Witness 7 1 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness Fortunately, the shoe comes back strong in the outsole. This must be the toughest part of the Lebron Witness 7. Using a durometer to check its rubber hardness, we found that it is a head taller than most basketball shoes on our list. With a reading of 85.8 HC, it is notably harder than average! And that always implies a more hard-wearing outsole. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Lebron Witness 7 85.8 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole thickness The amount of rubber used for the outsole is also quite substantial. We measured it at 4.1 mm which is a solid thickness for a $100 shoe. Based on its hardness and thickness as well as performance on the court, we can wholeheartedly recommend the Nike Lebron Witness 7 for outdoor play. That also includes the most abrasive concrete courts. Test results Lebron Witness 7 4.1 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness Of course, this highly cushioned hoop shoe from LeBron had to have a very well-padded insole. We measured its thickness at 5 mm, a little cushier than average. Test results Lebron Witness 7 5.0 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole The shoe's insole is easily removable. It can be replaced with a custom insert is needed. Test results Lebron Witness 7 Yes Tongue padding The tongue is sufficiently padded on this LeBron shoe. Based on our caliper measurement, it is 9 mm thick. About the same as the average. Test results Lebron Witness 7 9.0 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type Given the shoe's budget-friendly price point, a gusseted tongue is not to be expected here. But the standard non-attached tongue of the Witness 7 is still doing a pretty good job of staying in place and holding the foot. Test results Lebron Witness 7 None Heel tab A fabric finger loop at the back helps with getting the shoe on with less effort. It also adds a stylish flair to the overall look of the Witness 7.

Issue #5 Adidas D.O.N. Issue #5 review Dimitrije Curcic on Jul 9, 2024 | Reviewed using methodology 1.7 Our verdict Donovan \"Spida\" Mitchell is back again with a new shoe, the D.O.N. Issue 5. According to our lab and wear tests, this model focuses on traction and containment. We felt quick and surefooted in our games thanks to its stable yet streamlined structure, which features some extra arch support on the medial area in the form of the Three Stripes Adidas logo. Its outsole showed outstanding performance regarding traction outdoors and indoors, beating even dusty courts after a couple of wipes. Nevertheless, its upper and outsole materials aren't the most durable, so you might need to change hooping pals sooner rather than later. Top pick in best Adidas basketball shoes (2024) Pros Incredibly good traction Lots of stability and containment (extra midfoot support) Adapts to different playstyles Feels quick on foot Smooth heel-to-toe transitions Recycled upper (50%) On the affordable side Cons Not responsive Outsole lacks durability Weird tongue design Audience verdict 90 Great!

You want to feel surefooted and supported but you don't fancy bulky hoopers. You're trying different positions on the court and you need a versatile pair. You would love some extra arch support. Who should not buy During our wear tests, the D.O.N. Issue 5's materials felt quite cheap. We verified this in our lab using the Dremel, which showed us this shoe's outsole is not ready for abrasive surfaces. In other words: forget about playing streetball if you want this pair to last! If you're looking for a more resistant pal to play some ball outside, you should have a look at our outdoor basketball shoes catalog . Your browser does not support the video tag. If you need a new hooper with a lot of impact protection for your jumps but you don't want to give up surefootness, the Nike LeBron Witness 7 might be what you're looking for. This shoe offers great lateral stability for unstable landings, and it's from LeBron's budget line! Cushioning Heel stack At 30.3 mm, this shoe's heel stack is slightly higher than average. This gave us some extra support in the rearfoot during our playtests, yet we can't say we felt the Issue 5's foam was responsive. A little bouncy at best, yeah, but that's pretty much it. Your browser does not support the video tag. You can see it in the picture when we cut this shoe in half: it doesn't have any specific technologies from Adidas. Its midsole features a full-bed of Lightstrike foam and a strong shank. Even though this combination wasn't uncomfortable or any of the likes for our feet, we did feel it slightly stiff in our ride. Far from being a problem, this only added some extra points to the shoe's overall supportive nature. Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 30.3 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack The forefoot stack is just about average, according to our caliper. At 21.4 mm, we could feel the court pretty well under our feet. Even though this shoe is not the most bouncy out there, we felt quick and light during our playtests, which is something we believe to be ideal for players whose playstyle relies on quick footwork and speedy moves. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 21.4 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop After comparing the stack height at the toes and at the heel, we concluded this shoe has a drop of 8.9 mm. We can clearly see in the picture that the Issue 5's heel is more elevated than the forefoot area, which gave us some extra cushioning whilst letting us feel the court closer with our ball of the foot. Even before we cut the shoe in half in our lab, when we were playing ball we could feel a lot of supportiveness in our midfoot. Like, a real lot! Then we found out this shoe had some extra arch support added to the side. Look! Adidas' Three Stripes logo acts as a containment and supportive feature that offered us a wonderful snug fit during our playtests. Thanks to this, we felt more confident hooping, which is something that every player should get from their shoes! Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 8.9 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. When our durometer showed us a reading 16% lower than average, we knew our feet were right when we felt this Adidas model was on the softer side. At 22.0 HA, this midsole's lack of hardness was strategically compensated by the stiffness of the shank we mentioned before. Thanks to the brand's intelligent decision, we could enjoy the best of both worlds: comfort and support. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 22.0 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Adidas D.O.N. Issue #5 fits slightly small (22 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit At 104.0 mm, our caliper had to open up way more than average to give us this measurement! This was great news for our standard-width feet, as we felt we had plenty of space! So we didn't have to deal with any hot-spots in this area, yay! This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 104.0 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width But... the Issue 5 tappers quite A LOT towards the toe! At 72.4 mm, we definitely can't recommend it to wide-foot hoopers, as they'd feel constrained. What's more, this shoe's materials are not stretchy at all! So don't expect it to accommodate wider feet after some time... it won't happen! Your browser does not support the video tag. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 72.4 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Flexibility / Stiffness So far, our lab tests indicated a wonderful mix of stiffness and softness. Basically, its balance structure gives us some support right where we want it, and also some softness whenever we need extra comfort. Your browser does not support the video tag. With a score of 37.8N, our gauge confirmed what our feet felt: despite the overall rigid structure, this model didn't have any problems bending easily along our feet! This translated into smoother transitions and shot drills in our wear tests. Why? Because the ball of the foot is constantly bent when you train shooting mechanics. And the Adidas D.O.N. Issue 5 is perfect for that! This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 37.8N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight With its resistant upper, we guessed this shoe wouldn't be as light as a feather. At 13.8 oz/390g, these Adidas weight is just average. And that's exactly how the Issue 5 felt in our feet when we played with it: average! It wasn't super heavy despite having durable upper materials, which we appreciated; but we would never say it's a light model either. Your browser does not support the video tag. All in all, its weight was not an issue when we performed quick and explosive moves. If you're a versatile player who might change positions, this model might work for you. Nevertheless, if your playstyle relies on quick and heavy footwork, you might want to have a look at our lightweight basketball shoes catalog . Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 13.8 oz (390g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability Our first test in the lab has 4 main characters: our smoke machine, our microscope, our light, and the Adidas D.O.N. Issue 5! We started by grabbing our smoke machine and moving it all the way to the shoe's opening. What we do is fill it all the way up with smoke and wait patiently, looking carefully at any spot that might let the smoke get away. Your browser does not support the video tag. It doesn't stand a chance against the Under Armour Curry Flow 10 regarding ventilation, that's for sure! We waited, and waited, and... waited some more. Yet the toebox's airflow was nowhere to be found! These Adidas definitely skipped getting the lowest score in our breathability test thanks to its unique tongue. A 2/5, that is! Come on, now! What's with that bait? Don't tell us those round details don't look like tiny ventilation holes! Well, our microscope said: \"Not today\", once we saw this close-up of the black dots. They're there to level up this shoe's style, that's it! Your browser does not support the video tag. Our light test was the last evidence: it's the tongue the one that lets this shoe breathe! When we put the Issue 5 on in the summer to play some streetball, our feet were sweating like crazy. We did try thinner socks, but... it didn't solve the issue. And it was the same when we played on indoor courts! If you're looking for a breathable pal to play with when temperatures go up, you should check our air-flowing hooping kings and queens . Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 2 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test During our wear tests, we felt this shoe was very stable! We know we've mentioned it before, but we want to highlight that this is an incredibly important feature for a basketball shoe. Your browser does not support the video tag. Check how stable our ankles and feet look in the video above. Well, that's exactly how we felt! We loved this, as feeling safe is a crucial base point to perform more aggressive moves and jumps. Let us give you a quick example: we wouldn't go for an alley-oop against a zone defense if we didn't feel surefooted enough! In the front, we have a low-height stack that lets us feel closer to the ground and, consequently more stable. In the middle, we've got a supportive structure on the medial side. And in the back? Drums, please... A wonderful heel clip! This structural piece gave us even more support, so heel slippage was totally out of the question! To summarise, our overall experience regarding stability with the D.O.N. issue 5 was terrific. Torsional rigidity And more support is on the way! Your browser does not support the video tag. We tried to bend, pinch, twist, and wring this shoe, but it didn't even give in a little bit. As you can imagine, it scored a perfect 5/5 on our torsional rigidity test. Honestly, if this test was any longer, we might have needed to go to a physiotherapist... our thumbs were exhausted! Such high torsional rigidity also has its downside, which is a break-in period. It was not horrible, though, at least for us! Or maybe it's that we're comparing it with the hell on earth we were given by the Nike LeBron 21 ? Now those were blisters, oof! Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness The Issue 5's whole structure favours containment, so we thought the heel counter would get a high score in our stiffness test. Nevertheless, we didn't feel that during our wear tests. Before we describe it to you, let us show you a video. Your browser does not support the video tag. We can clearly see it's bendy, but just from the middle of the heel up! The bottom part features a TPU heel clip that supports this area, and we literally couldn't get enough of this wonderful move Adidas smartly pulled off! Your browser does not support the video tag. This shoe got a 3/5 in our heel counter stiffness test, which is slightly below the average. Yet, thanks to the heel clip, our feet didn't move an inch! Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 3 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot When our caliper returned 110.9 mm we just couldn't close our mouths. How was it possible for such a stable model to get such a low score when we measured its midsole's width in the forefoot? We literally couldn't believe it but, to be honest... our feet did feel how streamlined this model is during our wear tests. Yet, as this didn't translate into instability, we didn't really pay a lot of attention to it until we brought the shoe back to the lab. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 110.9 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The heel doesn't follow the same path, though! At 95.4 mm, the midsole in this area is way wider than average. This only led to more stability. Just imagine how wonderfully the wider base and heel clip worked hand in hand! Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 95.4 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability When we took this shoe out of its box we already knew our Dremel was going to have trouble fighting its upper. At a speed of 5K RPM and with a pressure of 3.2N, we grabbed our tool and attacked the Issue 5's toebox for 12 seconds. Your browser does not support the video tag. We could see black dust flying around, but that's just a protective overlayer! Even though our Dremel managed to get through it, this didn't have a negative effect on the shoe's integrity. Consequently, this model got a well-deserved 4/5 in our toebox durability test. Just in case you want to see what it looks like when our Dremel doesn't lose its battle, have a look at this: The Under Armour Charged Assert 10 got completely destroyed. Just look at that, that's definitely a 1/5 in this same durability test, no doubt! The D.O.N. Issue 5's suede overlayer and rubber compound fought bravely, but the UA model's mesh... was our Dremel's dinner. Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 4 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability We moved our tool all the way back to test the heel padding durability. This part of the shoe is usually more fragile, let's see if our Dremel agrees! Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see in the video, this shoe has a superior piece designed to hug your ankle snugly. It embraces the back of the foot nicely, and we definitely felt it during our wear tests. Nevertheless, we can't say the Issue 5's hug will be as long as you might want it to. The considerable damages left by our tool made us give it a standard 3/5 in our heel padding durability test. We can't say it's a perfect score, but it's not that bad if we compare it with the messed heel that the Under Armour Charged Assert 9 ended up with after our Dremel came by to say hello! Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 3 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness When an outsole gets a higher score in our durometer, it usually means it's more durable. On the other hand, if the score is lower, it means the compound prioritises traction. At 75.1 HC, this shoe's outsole is 9% less hard than average. This wasn't only what our durometer stated, because our feet would definitely say the same thing if they could talk! Your browser does not support the video tag. During our wear tests, we played ball outdoors and indoors. In every single surface we hooped on, the Issue 5 performed incredibly well regarding traction. It bit anything and everything, and we felt surefooted even if we tried crossover steps or backdoor cuts. Your browser does not support the video tag. We'll talk about this shoe's grip later on, but we are so happy with it that we just had to mention it! Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 75.1 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability Even though we were incredibly happy with this shoe's outsole grip (no more spoilers, though!) we can't say the same about its durability. Your browser does not support the video tag. After a 22-second-long drilling session with the same pressure (3.2N) but at a higher speed (10K RPM), we grabbed our tread gauge and saw a dent of 1.3 mm. This result is slightly higher than average and, in this case... higher doesn't mean better! After analysing the hardness and durability of the outsole, we can say we wouldn't recommend this model to play streetball. Why? Well, because this hooper will definitely last way less if you make it go through the abrasion of outdoor courts! And it would be a shame to make this pair lose its wonderful traction. It'll still be grippy on outdoor courts, that's what our wear tests playing streetball tell us; yet... the surface will wear out its pattern, making the outsole lose its top traction. Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 1.3 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness When our caliper showed 2.9 mm, we simply shook our heads: streetball will destroy the Issue 5! Now that we have the results of the 3 key tests that assess outdoor use, we need to advise you against it. If you want your new ball pal to have a longer and happier life, use it in indoor courts! Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 2.9 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness The D.O.N. issue 5 features a simple insole. No fuss, no problems, no crazy stuff. At 4.3 mm, our caliper confirmed it's just average. Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 4.3 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole First of all: Look. At. This. Insole! It features Donovan 'Spida' Mitchell logo, and we loved it (it looks like a spider, can you see it?)! Leaving the style aside, the fact that this insole is removable is simply the cherry on top! Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 Yes Reflective elements No reflective elements here! Pitch black it is. Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 No Tongue padding Even though we were pretty happy with this shoe's snug fit, we can't say it was because of its tongue. At 5.2 mm, our caliper claimed it is an incredibly 83% less padded than average! You know what this means, right? Watch out for lace bite! It's true that the Issue 5's supportive nature helps with this, but we felt the eyelets were not on our side... The lace loops looked a bit flimsy, but what confused us the most was the last one. As you can see, it's not a loop anymore, but an eyelet as a hole in the upper. We actually felt it might break if we pulled too hard, which we didn't like at all! You know, one of this shoe's strongest points is its containment, and every piece and detail should be on board. Still, we want to say that during our wear tests, we pulled the laces and went for a tight and snug fit. The fact that the top eyelet is part of the shoe's upper helped us with this, as we felt the entire structure was hugging our feet. Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 5.2 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type When we put this shoe on for the first time, we actually took our sweet time checking and trying to understand its tongue. In our lab, we could see it's a both sides semi-gusseted tongue, yet the medial side is fully sewn, up to the top! Here we have the outer side, now look at the inner one! Adidas, if you were trying to show us how innovative you are... it worked! This is a 2 piece tongue that opens up laterally, covering the whole instep. The whole experience was just... different. Let's move on to the tongue padding so we can explain why! Test results D.O.N. Issue #5 Both sides (semi) Heel tab The Adidas D.O.N. Issue 5 features a finger-loop at the heel.

It locked our feet so securely in place that we never once felt a hint of wobble. We believe that shifter players who often make forceful side-to-side cuts will adore this shoe. It inspires a great deal of confidence for moving aggressively on the court (as long as it's a clean indoor court).

We verified that it is not durable enough for outdoor use. It appears to have issues with dust pickup as well. The Nike G.T. Cut 2 and the Nike Cosmic Unity 3 proved to have a much stronger outdoor performance. Your browser does not support the video tag. And if you want a much more reliable traction that's immune to dust, we recommend the PUMA All Pro Nitro and the Nike Lebron NXXT GEN . Cushioning Heel stack On foot, the Jordan Luka 2 hits a sweet spot between impact protection and court feel. Measuring its heel stack with a caliper, we got 28.2 mm. This is nearly the same as the average. Your browser does not support the video tag. There is a moderate amount of cushioning which provides a good deal of impact protection for most players. Sure, you won't get the same bottomless cushioning as in the G.T. Jump 2 , but there is just enough for a standard basketball shoe. Test results Luka 2 28.2 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack The shoe's forefoot stack height of 22.2 mm will most likely feel familiar because it is just the same as the average. It is neither too high off the ground nor too low and sensitive. Test results Luka 2 22.2 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop Based on our stack measurements, the heel-to-toe drop of the Luka 2 comes at only 6.0 mm. It is on the lower end of the basketball shoe spectrum. The key benefit of this setup is that it places the heel on nearly the same level as the toes creating a more stable underfoot experience. Test results Luka 2 6.0 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. The Luka 2 relies on the Formula 23 foam for its primary cushioning. In our colorway, this foam is black and almost takes up the shoe's entire midsole. It is caged inside a firmer carrier EVA foam for better stability. That's why the cushioning of this Jordan shoe generally feels firm. Your browser does not support the video tag. Pressing our Shore A durometer against the Formula 23, we got a standard reading of 26.5 HA. It is no harder than the average basketball shoe cushioning. Interestingly, the Luka 2 features several perforations in the heel area to add shock absorption. Pretty cool implementation of the \"less is more\" principle by Jordan. Smaller apertures are also placed under the big toe. We've never seen a design like this but it offered a pretty nice push-off. Test results Luka 2 26.5 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Secondary foam softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. Checking the shoe's carrier foam, we found that it is not that much firmer than the Formula 23. With a reading of 30 HA, it is only 13% firmer than the primary cushioning. We found that it's hard enough to provide great stability but doesn't feel too hard to cause discomfort or make the underfoot experience dull. Test results Luka 2 29.9 HA Average 27.8 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Size and fit Size Jordan Luka 2 fits true to size (28 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit Measuring the Luka's toebox in the widest part, our caliper showed 102.1 mm. This is just the same as the average of our lab-tested hoop shoes in a men's US size 9. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Luka 2 102.1 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width However, the shoe's generous toe space is felt closer to the big toe. That's where we measured the width at 85.1 mm - over 8 mm wider than average! This Jordan shoe is a bit more friendly to wide-footed players than most hoop shoes. Your browser does not support the video tag. We should also mention that the shoe's mesh fabric has no stretch to it at all. This is very important for its capacity to stay supportive in the long term. P.S. Please keep in mind that the rest of the shoe feels very much true to size offering some of the best containment we've come across. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Luka 2 85.1 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Midfoot cage and laces We rarely see the implementation of this lace cage in basketball shoes. The closest one is probably the Adidas Harden Vol. 7 . Even though it adds some bulk and stiffness to the shoe, we found that this wrapped cage design provides some of the strongest footholds. The cage is accompanied by three lace loops throughout the tongue that help to secure the tongue in place. It is also very easy to cinch up the fit with this setup and the laces stay securely in place throughout the game. Flexibility / Stiffness Even though the Jordan Luka 2 is stiff, it's not as unforgivably stiff as some of the other models. Your browser does not support the video tag. We bent the shoe to a 90-degree angle in our flexibility test, measuring how much force it would take to do that. With a gauge reading of 32.1N, it turned out to be 27% more flexible than our current average among basketball shoes. So don't worry - a pinch of patience and the shoe will grow on you. We also noticed a peculiar outsole split near the toes. It added a touch of flexibility in the area where we didn't think we needed it - in between the toes! It came into play at the toe-offs allowing the big toe (our main pushing force) to compress independently from the rest of the forefoot. It is not a game changer by any means but a welcome touch indeed! The only complaint we have about the Luka 2 in the flexibility department is that the thick overlays on the toebox were digging into our metatarsals pretty badly. The pinching caused chafing and made band-aids a must for this Jordan shoe. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Luka 2 32.1N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight Even though it is a low-top and not-so-bulky shoe, the Luka 2 carries a bit more weight than we expected. Putting it on a scale in a men's US size 9, we recorded 14.5 oz (411g). It is only slightly heavier than average. The Luka 2's stiff construction might as well make it feel heavier than it actually is, especially for lighter players. If you do want a lighter alternative, we recommend the PUMA All Pro Nitro (13.2 oz/373g) or the UA Curry 10 (12.6 oz/358g). Test results Luka 2 14.5 oz (411g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability With the Luka 2's hard focus on support, the shoe did neglect proper ventilation. Your browser does not support the video tag. Pumping smoke into the shoe's upper, almost none of it passed through the tightly woven mesh. Even though it looked promising in our transparency check. Your browser does not support the video tag. When we looked closer at the mesh through our microscope, we saw that there was indeed very little potential for the airflow. No pores, perforations, or ventilation holes. That's why the Jordan Luka 2 felt pretty toasty mid-game on our feet forcing us to give it the lowest possible breathability score of 1 out of 5. For a basketball shoe with similar features but a much better ventilation capacity, have a look at the Under Armour Curry 10 . Test results Luka 2 1 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Designed to accommodate Luka Doncic's aggressive playing style, the Luka 2 shoe is packed with stability components (much like the Luka 1 was). Your browser does not support the video tag. Our wear tests showed that it offers ridiculously strong side-to-side containment and a stable base for hard and quick cuts, sidesteps, and stepbacks. Your browser does not support the video tag. The Jordan Luka 2 features stability elements both inside and around the shoe. Inside, there is a strong zigzaggy plate running between the outsole and the midsole. It is called IsoPlate and its stiff nature treated us to a very stable footing, especially when we performed hard lateral shifts. On the inner side of the Luka 2, there is a firm and rather big medial sidewall. It prevented our arches from collapsing inwards. A TPU panel on the lateral side had a similar function of stabilizing our feet. Finally, the shoe comes with a sturdy leathery cage that wraps around the entire upper. It is connected to the shoe's exceptionally secure lacing system which we cover in more detail below. Torsional rigidity All of the aforementioned stability features are reflected in the Jordan Luka 2's exceptionally rigid build. Your browser does not support the video tag. Twisting it with our hands proved to be impossible. The torsional rigidity of this Jordan shoe undercuts many other models we've tested earning a solid 5 out of 5. Don't mind the fact that it is a low-top shoe. Your ankles are safe with the Jordan Luka 2. Test results Luka 2 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness What makes the Luka 2 THAT much more supportive is its stiffer-than-average heel counter. Your browser does not support the video tag. Giving it a good push and squeeze in our manual test, we confidently rated it with the highest stiffness score - 5 out of 5. What it means in practice is that you get a death grip around your heels and ankles. That heel counter just wouldn't let our heels shift one millimeter. Not did it let the ankle buckle one bit. Mind-blowing support and stability right there! Test results Luka 2 5 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot This Jordan shoe doesn't even have a particularly wide base but it does have a considerable outrigger in the forefoot. Measuring it in the widest part with our caliper returned 113.9 mm. It is exactly the same as the average basketball shoe. Test results Luka 2 113.9 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The heel of the Luka 2's sole turned out to be even narrower than average. We measured 84.1 mm I'm the widest part. But it didn't feel narrow by any means! On foot, it felt a lot like most other hoop shoes we've tested. Test results Luka 2 84.1 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability There is a good reason why the mesh material of this Jordan shoe is very protected - this fabric is pretty wear-resistant as is. Your browser does not support the video tag. Drilling it with sandpaper for 12 seconds at a 5K RPM speed and 3.2N pressure, we only got through the topmost layer of mesh. As you can see from the shoe on the right, some mesh uppers fail to survive the same test entirely. Thus, the toebox durability of the Luka 2 gets a middle-of-the-road score of 3 out of 5. Test results Luka 2 3 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability Inside, the Luka 2 is equipped with a much sturdier material. Your browser does not support the video tag. In an attempt to put a hole in the shoe's heel lining, we turned to our Dremel once again. With consistent speed (5K RPM) and pressure (3.2N) applied for 4 seconds, the fabric looked barely touched! As one of the most wear-resistant heel linings in our lab, it earned the highest durability score of 5 out of 5. P.S. Keep in mind that this fabric is also a bit rough and might chafe bare skin. We recommend wearing taller socks at least for the break-in period. Test results Luka 2 5 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness Jordan chose translucent rubber over hard rubber for the outsole of the Luka 2. Does it mean that it's less durable? Let's find out. Measuring the shoe's outsole hardness with a Shore C durometer, we got a slightly lower-than-average reading of 76.4 HC. This indicates a bit softer compound that is often more prone to abrasion, especially on hard outdoor courts. Test results Luka 2 76.4 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability But we were pleasantly surprised by the wear resistance that the shoe's rubber showed in our Dremel test. Your browser does not support the video tag. Drilling it for 22 seconds at a ramped-up speed (10K RPM) and consistent pressure (3.2N), the rubber got as little as 0.6 mm of damage! That's even less than the average. Test results Luka 2 0.6 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness Now we look at the amount of rubber packed into the shoe's outsole. With a caliper measurement of 3.5 mm, it is slightly thinner than average but not critically. To sum it all up, we believe that the Jordan Luka 2 is going to last just as long as your typical basketball shoe if you play indoors. We wouldn't recommend using the shoe on concrete courts regularly because its translucent rubber, while durable, will lose its soft and thin treading much faster resulting in poor grip. Test results Luka 2 3.5 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness The Jordan Luka 2 features a moderately thick insole to buffer the foot from the shoe's firmness. Measuring it with a caliper revealed that it is 4.5 mm thick in the heel - just the same as the average. Test results Luka 2 4.5 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole You have the option to remove the shoe's stock insole if you want to customize the in-shoe experience. Test results Luka 2 Yes Tongue padding Contributing to the in-shoe comfort is a very generously padded tongue. Based on our caliper measurement of 15.1 mm, it is notably puffier than average. Test results Luka 2 15.1 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type The Luka 2 features a semi-attached tongue that works together with the insanely secure midfoot cage.

We believe that this is the case where a high price tag is absolutely justified. For us, this shoe is an instant top pick in the durability and stability departments. And for sure, it is among the best options for outdoor use that we've seen in a while. If Nike fixes its firm midsole and trims down the weight for the next iteration, we are ready to claim it as THAT SHOE.

If you want a softer and more responsive Zoom Air cushioning, go with the v2. We also found that it is a whopping 2.3 oz (65g) lighter! Your browser does not support the video tag. Another great alternative, in our opinion, is the Nike KD 15 . It is 1.7 oz (48g) lighter, has plusher and bouncier cushioning, and is just as great for outdoor courts. Cushioning Shock absorption New Considering the shoe's firm cushioning setup, we were surprised that the Cosmic Unity 3 showed the same shock absorption as the average hoop shoe. This means that you can still expect good impact protection in both the heel (103 SA) and in the forefoot (79 SA). Heel Forefoot Test results Cosmic Unity 3 103 SA Average 103 SA Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 62 SA Shock absorption 121 SA Energy return New This Nike shoe also feels pleasantly dynamic and responsive, showing a standard energy return in our tests. Its drop-in midsole is the primary source of rebound with 56.6% in the heel and 59.1% in the forefoot. Heel Forefoot Test results Cosmic Unity 3 59.1% Average 61.0% Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 46.0% Energy return 81.0% Heel stack The shoe's cushioning comprises a drop-in midsole that sits on top of an embedded midsole. We measured the combined stack height of these two. Our caliper showed 27.9 mm in the heel, which is slightly thinner than average but still in the medium range. Less cushioning typically translates to a better ground feel and we can confirm that the Cosmic Unity 3 feels more grounded. Test results Cosmic Unity 3 27.9 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack In the forefoot, we measured the stack height at 20.7 mm. It is also considered average for a basketball shoe. It is neither too thin to hurt the ball of the foot not extra cushioned. Test results Cosmic Unity 3 20.7 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop Calculating the difference between the heel and the forefoot height, we get a drop of 7.2 mm. This slight elevation of the heel above the toes is right at the average of hoop shoes. We believe that it will suit most players. Bigger guys and gals, on the other hand, may benefit from a higher drop as it gives more impact protection in the heel. Some shoes like that include the Adidas Dame 8 (10.4 mm). Test results Cosmic Unity 3 7.2 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. To us, this part of the shoe has become the biggest disappointment. The cushioning of the Nike Cosmic Unity 3 is a far-far cry from the brand's claim of \"cloud-like cushioning.\" We repeated the durometer measurement several times to make sure we are not biased and yet every time the tool confirmed our experience - this shoe is firm. At 33.3 HA, the Cosmic Unity 3 is about 20% firmer than average. Because of that, the shoe feels dense (and even thin) and definitely lacks impact protection for our moderate body weight. Unfortunately, it is a downgrade from the second iteration which was 32% softer and felt amply cushioned despite the lower stack height. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Cosmic Unity 3 33.3 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Nike Cosmic Unity 3 fits slightly small (58 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit Having retrieved a gel replica of this Nike shoe's interiors, we measured its widest part at 93.6 mm. Your browser does not support the video tag. Even though it is slightly wider than average, the shoe still falls into the medium-width range but with a touch of wiggle room. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Cosmic Unity 3 93.6 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width On the flip side, the shoe's toebox has some tapering towards the toes, which is reflected in a below-average width of 67.8 mm near the big toe. However, it's not aggressive enough to cause any serious toe jamming for a medium-width foot. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Cosmic Unity 3 67.8 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height The Cosmic Unity 3 doesn't skimp on vertical space either with am above-average toebox height of 25.4 mm. Test results Cosmic Unity 3 25.4 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Traction / Grip Forefoot traction New The Nike Cosmic Unity 3 returned one of the lowest friction scores in our lab. At only 0.55, it lacks the bite offered by its counterparts in the same price range. While it's not a slipping hazard per se, it can detract from confidence during high-pressure situations in the paint. Test results Cosmic Unity 3 0.55 Average 0.76 Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.55 Forefoot traction 0.99 Outsole design New The Cosmic Unity 3's reduced gripping capacity could be due to its segmented rubber coverage as well as its thick and recessed tread pattern. But on a positive note, the latter makes this Nike shoe a great option for streetball. Flexibility / Stiffness New Being such a sturdy shoe, the Nike Cosmic Unity 3 loses a bit on the flexibility front. It doesn't bend very easily on the foot and as our lab test shows, it's not very bendy per se. It took 23.1N of force to get the shoe to flex in the forefoot, according to our lab machine. We anticipate that the shoe will get more flexible with use but the break-in period is going to take a while. We felt less maneuverable in the Cosmic Unity 3 but in return, we got smoother heel-to-toe transitions and enhanced stability. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Cosmic Unity 3 23.1N Average 20.4N Compared to 26 basketball shoes Number of shoes 13.4N Flexibility <> Stiffness 25.9N Weight Apparently, being a durable shoe has its price. The Nike Cosmic Unity 3 gained some serious weight compared to its predecessor. It now tips the scales at 15.7 oz (444g) whereas the average of our lab-tested hoop shoes is 13.7 oz (387g). It feels very substantial underfoot but it seems to be the trade-off for the unmatched wear resistance and overall support. Test results Cosmic Unity 3 15.7 oz (444g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability When we first saw all those layers of mesh and knit embracing the upper of the Cosmic Unity 3, we instantly thought \"Uh-oh, here comes a toaster.\" And yet, our smoke machine test proved that this Nike shoe found a way to ventilate the interiors. Based on the amount of smoke passing through the upper, we assessed its breathability with a rating of 3 out of 5. Your browser does not support the video tag. It is clear from the transparency test below which parts of the upper are responsible for the airflow. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Cosmic Unity 3 3 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Luckily, the Cosmic Unity 3 comes back strong when it comes to support and stability. This shoe made us feel contained like no other! Your browser does not support the video tag. The first salute goes out to supportive materials on the upper. All those sturdy woven layers of Flymesh and Flyknit blend together to lock the foot in place. We experienced zero in-shoe movement. Just look how little stretch (if any) there is in the upper! Torsional rigidity Our next shoutout goes to the plastic shank embedded into the midsole. It extends up on both sides, firmly bracing the arch. We haven't seen expanded shanks like that in quite some time. This design is responsible for the shoe's increased torsional rigidity. Twisting it is not that easy! On a scale from 1 to 5, where 5 is the stiffest, we rated it as 4. Your browser does not support the video tag. We consider it an essential stability component of the Nike Cosmic Unity 3. Test results Cosmic Unity 3 4 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness The shoe's heel cup was another pleasant surprise. First of all, it is notably stiffer than most basketball shoes. Giving it a good squeeze, we rated its stiffness as 4 out of 5. Your browser does not support the video tag. Secondly, the shoe's rear foot is designed in such a way that our heels ended up sitting quite deeply in it. Heel slippage is simply non-existent here. Test results Cosmic Unity 3 4 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot Finally, we cannot leave the shoe's wide base without attention. Measuring the widest part of the forefoot with a caliper, we found it to be 115.3 mm. This is a little wider than average. Having a wide landing area, we felt extra confident making sharp direction changes. Test results Cosmic Unity 3 115.3 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The Cosmic Unity 3 also features a wide heel area. We measured its widest part at 91 mm. A solid average for a hoop shoe. Test results Cosmic Unity 3 91.0 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability The wear resistance of this Nike shoe is INSANE! In addition to its mesmerizing looks, the embroidered upper of the Cosmic Unity 3 is also impressively strong. It survived our 12-second Dremel test with very minor damage and deserved the highest rating of 5/5. No wonder it is advertised for outdoor use! Your browser does not support the video tag. Seeing what the same test did to the cheaper Nike Lebron Witness 7 ($115), it becomes clear why the Cosmic Unity 3 is asking for $170. Of course, we couldn't help but explore the shoe's upper under our microscope in an attempt to reveal its secret durability formula. We can see how multiple layers of woven fabric create several layers of defense on the Nike Cosmic Unity 3. This shoe is ready for some serious wear and tear. Test results Cosmic Unity 3 5 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability Back in the heel, the collar padding also showed excellent results in our Dremel test. Pressing the tool against the material for 4 seconds, we saw smaller damage compared to basketball shoes on average. Your browser does not support the video tag. In this part of the upper, we rated the Cosmic Unity as 3 out of 5. Test results Cosmic Unity 3 3 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness The shoe's unmatched durability includes the outsole as well. Measuring the hardness of its rubber with a durometer, we found it to be 86.5 HC. This is harder than 81% of our lab-tested basketball shoes. And in our experience, it takes much longer to wear through hard rubbers. This fact in combination with our playtests allows us to wholeheartedly recommend the Nike Cosmic Unity 3 for outdoor use. Test results Cosmic Unity 3 86.5 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole thickness We also use a caliper to check how thick the outsole is. At 3.5 mm, it is not among the thickest we've seen. But we wouldn't be so concerned about that because the nature of the treads on the Cosmic Unity 3 looks very reassuring. Wide and deep, these lugs are not easy to wear off. Based on all of our findings in the durability department, we can claim this Nike shoe to be one of the best for outdoor use. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Cosmic Unity 3 3.5 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness Because the shoe comes with a drop-in midsole, there is no insole in the Cosmic Unity 3 per se. However, if you are wondering, the heel thickness of this component is 14.5 mm. We are not exactly sure why Nike went with this midsole design. But at least it gives us an opportunity to replace its underwhelming cushioning with something more fun and protective. Not to mention that it gives way to using custom orthotics. Test results Cosmic Unity 3 0.0 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole Remember that taking the insole out of the Nike Cosmic Unity 3 equates to removing the shoe's cushioning entirely. So you would need to find a thick replacement of at least 12 mm in the heel. Test results Cosmic Unity 3 Yes Tongue padding The shoe's tongue is much thinner than average. At 4.9 mm, it is nearly twice thinner. And yet, it feels fairly well-padded. We think that more padding in the tongue would be unnecessary as the shoe's upper offers plenty of support and in-shoe comfort as is. Test results Cosmic Unity 3 4.9 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type Surprisingly for its higher-end price point, the Cosmic Unity 3 doesn't have a gusseted tongue. However, this was never an issue for us as the tongue stayed in place and wrapped around our insteps comfortably. The tongue is pretty wide and is made of a neoprene-ish material, which apparently makes up a success formula for this Nike shoe. Test results Cosmic Unity 3 None Heel tab Because the edge of the shoe's collar is made of a pliable Flyknit material, having a finger loop to assist with putting it on is pretty handy. Test results Cosmic Unity 3 Finger loop Sustainable materials As a final bonus, the Cosmic Unity 3 is claimed to be partially made of responsibly sourced materials. These include recycled post-manufactured and post-consumer waste like yarns, textiles, and plastics.

(Yes, Precision 7 , we're looking at you). The Giannis Immortality 3 is here to be your partner no matter which position you play, as it's an incredibly solid all-rounder. It features Nike's Renew foam, which gave us that instant pop for quick plays, as well as a wide base for landings, and two long flex grooves in the outsole that favored lateral movements. As you can see, it's built for attack specialists, defense lovers, and anything in between! The only problem that we encountered during our wear tests playing basketball with the Immortality 3 is that its midsole bottoms out if you're on the heavy side or after constant use. Keep it in mind before you go for a pair! Top pick in best cheap basketball shoes (2024) Pros A solid all-rounder Springy Nike Renew foam Padded yet lightweight structure Pretty stable Smooth lateral moves and heel-to-toe transitions Decent traction in any court Comfortable right off the bat Good value for money Cons Midsole bottoms out prematurely Not enough impact protection Heavier than the previous version Audience verdict 84 Good!

A supportive shoe with a springy midsole for quick plays. Smooth transitions and lateral movements for defense. Great value-for-money! Who should NOT buy Even though the Giannis Immortality 3 is versatile enough to fit pretty much any kind of playstyle and position, we wouldn't recommend heavy or big centers to go for it. It's the same for hoopers whose playstyle relies on jumping a lot. Its soft cushioning bottoms out sooner than expected, and it might even end up making your joints suffer. If you don't want to spend a million dollars and you're looking for some superb impact protection, we believe you should have a look at the Nike Lebron Witness 7 , which is a model from LB's budget line. Your browser does not support the video tag. If you're a light and quick player and you're looking for something nimble that doesn't break the bank, the Nike Precision 7 might be a perfect fit. It offers a very breathable structure and high-quality materials, as well as improved stability and consistent grip. But the best part is that we felt really quick playing in it! Cushioning Heel stack Once cut the shoe in half, we get access to so many different pieces. In this case, we grabbed our caliper and measured the heel stack. At 29.7 mm, it's pretty much average. We can't say there's a lot of foam there, but it's definitely soft and it helped us smoothen up our landings. The problem with the Immortality 3's cushioning is that... it kind of bottoms out after a while. Especially if you're big! In other words, if you use this shoe non-stop or if you're on the heavier/bigger side, it'll definitely feel like the cushioning is fading. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Giannis Immortality 3 29.7 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack Nike used a little bit more foam in the forefoot in this 3rd iteration than in the Immortality 2, making it higher than the average for basketball shoes, too. Our caliper returned 24.7 mm, which means this shoe focuses on comfort. Even though it's neither the most responsive pair out there nor the one that lets you feel the court under your feet better, we could feel the underfoot comfort that Nike was thinking about when softening things up. And we loved it! Test results Giannis Immortality 3 24.7 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop The heel and forefoot stacks are not very different in the Immortality 3, so it's got a 5.0 mm drop. We can clearly see in the picture that this shoe is close to being flat. But don't worry, it doesn't feel like that when you put it on. In fact, apart from the soft foam, Nike has added a long shank that keeps the ride stable and supportive. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Giannis Immortality 3 5.0 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. As we were hinting throughout the whole review, the Immortality 3 has a softer foam. And it's not only softer than the average, it's also softer than the one the Immortality 2 features. At 23.9 HA, our feet were totally right when they had this almost kind of pillowy feeling going up and down the court. Nike used a chunk of Renew foam as the midsole of this shoe, which we found soft and kind of springy. Your browser does not support the video tag. We really appreciated this, as the brand didn't include any of its top technologies in this model. But hey, we aren't complaining... the Immortality 3 is a budget shoe after all! We couldn't expect it to have Air Zoom or other similar technologies. Test results Giannis Immortality 3 23.9 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Nike Giannis Immortality 3 fits slightly small (99 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit At 102.1 mm, our caliper indicated this Giannis pair has an average toebox width at the widest part. As you can see, the tool is measuring the upper. That platform you see right under the claw is what we call sole flare. The sole flare is an extension of the material of the sole that enhances the stability levels of a shoe. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Giannis Immortality 3 102.1 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width The toebox is just a little bit narrower than average at the big toe, as our caliper returned 76.0 mm. This width was alright for our standard-sized feet. Our toes didn't feel too cramped, and we had a little bit of space, so it wasn't uncomfortable. You can see it better in this picture. The toebox is not too pointy at the top, yet it does narrow down quite a bit, so we believe the Immortality 3 might not be the best choice for hoopers with quite wide feet. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Giannis Immortality 3 76.0 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Flexibility / Stiffness Despite its high torsional rigidity, the Immortality 3 managed to get a score lower than average on our flex test: 35.5N. Your browser does not support the video tag. During our wear tests, the shoe moved alongside our feet easily. This helped us a lot when we were playing, as we didn't feel anything stopping us from bending the ball of the foot as much as we needed for Euro steps, crossover steps, pump fakes... and anything in between. The best part is that this Nike has a high torsional rigidity, which means its materials are supportive and protective; yet at the same time, its flexibility levels are perfect for quick and explosive moves, as it's a bendy shoe in the ball of the foot. In summary, a budget all-rounder. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Giannis Immortality 3 35.5N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight Honestly, we did feel pretty light playing in this. It's not like the Immortality 3 is super responsive or anything like that, so don't think about insane toe-offs or springy changes of direction. Its foam is a bit bouncy, yeah, but it's thanks to the overall low weight of the shoe that we were able to move easily around the court. At 11.9 oz/337g, the Immortality 3 is a solid 14% lighter than average. This would be a great score if the Immortality 2 wasn't around. We did expect Nike to reduce the weight a little bit more, we're not gonna lie, as the previous version of this shoe marked 11.29 oz/320g on our scale. Your browser does not support the video tag. Our feet didn't feel the difference, though. It's not the lightest shoe on the market, but it feels pretty nice on foot. Also, we could tell that this 3rd version was more padded and softer than the previous one, which we really liked! That's probably one of the reasons why the Immortality 3 is now heavier.

We started with our breathability test, so we grabbed our smoke machine, light, and microscope. Are you ready? Cause here we go! Your browser does not support the video tag. Oh, won't you look at that! The Immortality 3 let some smoke get through its toebox and, as you can see, its sides also joined the airflow party. Compared to the Nike Book 1 , which scored a 1/5 on our breathability test, we can assure you the Immortality 3 won't make your feet sweat that much. Your browser does not support the video tag. Here in RunRepeat, we always cut shoes in half. In that way, we make sure we know even the tiniest detail of them! In this case, we grabbed our freshly cut upper and put it in front of a light. It shines in some points, showing that the mesh is less tightly woven. Also, if you pay close attention, the light goes all the way out in the curvature of the Swoosh. Yep, that means breathability! Regarding the upper, we can see mesh woven using different patterns. This shows that Nike crafted this shoe to give it durability and breathability, evening it out! Overall, we gave the Giannis Immortality 3 a solid 3/5 in breathability. And honestly, we can't complain! Test results Giannis Immortality 3 3 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Overall, the Immortality 3 offers good support. Its padded interiors, its snug lacing system with that extra eyelet on top for the runner's knot, and its tongue made the whole structure hug our feet comfortably. Your browser does not support the video tag. Apart from the shank, this Nike doesn't include any specific stability features. Still, this shoe feels pretty supportive! During our wear tests, we didn't feel unsafe or unstable. So, even if it's not a crazy model with some over-the-top stability features, it does fairly well for its price! Torsional rigidity Our torsional rigidity test just confirmed what we previously stated: the Immortality 3 doesn't include any specific stability technologies, yet it felt pretty stable to us during our wear tests. Your browser does not support the video tag. One of the reasons why our feet felt safe and sound in this shoe is its high torsional rigidity. You can see it clearly in the video: our fingers tried to bend and twist this Nike, but it was pointless! Its structure worked hard to stay in place and not give in, so we gave the Immortality 3 a well-deserved 4/5 in our torsional rigidity test. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Giannis Immortality 3 4 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness Its heel followed with another 4/5 in our heel counter stiffness test. Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see in the video, the sides give in, even if it's not as easily as in other models. So it's actually the heel itself holding the fort, doing its best not to bow down. If we combine this structured back setting with a runner's knot, we get a pretty solid support around the heel area. Which is also protected by the Immortality 3's padded nature, so no hot spots! Test results Giannis Immortality 3 4 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot There's something that we really loved about the Immortality 3. We've mentioned many times in the basketball world of RunRepeat how important it is to feel safe and confident when you're playing this sport, right? Well, out of the many features a shoe can include that can give you that feeling, a wide midsole is one of our favorites. Your browser does not support the video tag. At 120.5 mm, this Giannis pair is way wider than average, surpassing even its predecessor. This translated into incredibly stable landings. You know, after all, a wider midsole equals a wider platform to land after jumping! And what else could a hooper ask for? But wait, we're not done just yet! The sole flare also acts as an armor for toe dragging. Yeah, we know there's some people who claim they don't drag their toes, and that might be your case too! But to the rest of us, toe-dragging hoopers, this is a wonderful feature. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Giannis Immortality 3 120.5 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel Our caliper returned 94.2 mm, so the midsole width in the heel is also wider than average. Once again, we really appreciate this design choice from the brand. Even though it's important to land on your forefoot after jumping in order to protect your joints from direct impact, your heel comes second. And trust us, having a wider landing platform helps... a lot! Test results Giannis Immortality 3 94.2 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability Our next test requires some Herculean resistance, we're not gonna lie! Our Dremel is ready to devour everything it encounters. Let's see if the Immortality 3 is actually immortal. Your browser does not support the video tag. Our 12-second drilling session at 3.2N and a speed of 5K RPM was over in no time. And whilst we panicked when we saw the yellow threads flying around, we had faith this shoe would stand strong and show us the meaning of its name. Well, we can't complain! The tool couldn't get through the material. Additionally, there's a protective layer on the edges, can you see it? Our Dremel didn't touch that, but it's definitely resistant to abrasion. How do we know that, you ask? Well, because we've also done wear tests with the Immortality 3 and, after playing some streetball, we can confirm it: it's quite protective! Anyway, if we compare the results of Giannis' 3rd model with the ones of the Nike Precision 6 ... the difference is pretty crazy. The Precision 6 got completely destroyed, earning no more than a 1/5 on our toebox durability test. So the 3/5 we gave to the Immortality 3 doesn't sound half bad anymore, does it? Test results Giannis Immortality 3 3 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability It's really important for a basketball shoe (and pretty much every shoe, honestly) to have a durable heel. If you've played or watched this sport before, it's easy to understand why! It's not just sweaty feet, quick and explosive moves, and crazy counter attacks. If you post-play, you'll definitely get your feet stepped on; if you're a shooter, you'll most likely go for fakes... just think about your heel going up and down constantly! Your browser does not support the video tag. That's why we also use our Dremel in this test. But wow! If we didn't have recorded evidence, we might as well have thought we never used the tool to attach these Nikes' heel padding? Spotting the damage here is harder than looking for a needle in a haystack! This is undoubtedly a perfect 5/5 in heel padding durability. That was clean, Immortality 3! Just in case you need some extra proof where you can see our Dremel's destructive power, here is the Reebok Answer DMX and its disastrous 1/5 in heel padding durability. Test results Giannis Immortality 3 5 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness We use a durometer to measure the hardness of the outsole, look! At 84.9 HC, this shoe's outsole is just a little bit harder than average. Just not that much to make a big difference between traction and durability, so we believe the Immortality 3 offers a healthy mix of both. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Giannis Immortality 3 84.9 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability We got our hands on the Dremel again, just one last time. Even though this test is slightly tougher than the other durability ones (toebox and heel), it's because the outsole of every basketball shoe has to withstand the constant abrasion of the court. Your browser does not support the video tag. The attack lasted 22 seconds, at a speed of 10K RPM and a force of 3.2N. Once we lifted the tool, we had a look at the dent and measured it with our tread gauge. It returned 1.2 mm, which means the damage is slightly higher than average. This makes us say that the Immortality 3 might not be the best shoe to play streetball with. Even though it might endure a couple of games or some casual hoops, it might die before you'd want it to! Test results Giannis Immortality 3 1.2 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness Another reason why we believe this is not the best pair to play outdoors is that its outsole is 4.0 mm thick, according to our caliper. Even though this is not a bad score or anything like that (it's just the average), the rubber didn't show the best durability on our Dremel test. And it's not like the shoe has a thick layer with loads of material to wear out indefinitely! If you want to play some streetball, we believe you should check these hoopers out . Test results Giannis Immortality 3 4.0 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness At 4.4 mm, our caliper verified the Immortality 3's insole is just average. It goes in line with the whole shoe, so nothing super fancy. We will talk about this later on, but the good thing is that it's removable, so you can always change it if needed! Test results Giannis Immortality 3 4.4 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole We are huge fans of the freedom removable insoles give us as players (and we also love them as testers, of course). As long as the shoe's structure allows it, we can just swipe orthotics and find the one that works best with us! The Immortality 3 is a clear example. You can easily use your own orthotics with it! Test results Giannis Immortality 3 Yes Reflective elements This shoe doesn't have any reflective elements but, as a budget pair, it's not like we expected any! Test results Giannis Immortality 3 No Tongue padding At 5.5 mm, the tongue padding is nothing otherwordly. Nevertheless, and once again, we would like to congratulate Nike on its smart choice. The padding is more abundant near the top of the tongue, which is where we tie our laces. This is meant to protect our instep from any kind of lace bite, and it worked! Then the rest of the tongue is not super padded, probably to save up some weight. Still, our instep felt really comfortable, and we didn't have to deal with any kind of hot spot. Test results Giannis Immortality 3 5.5 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type We thought Nike made the right choice when it went for a semi-gusseted tongue in the Immortality 3. It gives some extra support, but it also gives the feet plenty of space to slide into the shoe comfortably. Even though it's easy thanks to its great features, let's not forget the Immortality 3 is a budget shoe... and gusseted tongues are not common among those! And one of the features we love the most is the double eyelet at the top! This makes the shoe's overall support levels go up like crazy, allowing us to go for a safe runners' knot if needed. Test results Giannis Immortality 3 Both sides (semi) Heel tab There's a really cool finger loop at the back of this shoe that matches its aesthetics perfectly. We're just using one finger in this picture but, as you can probably guess, there's plenty of space for more! As usual, we found this really convenient to put on and off the shoe.

This shoe's structure has not only improved regarding its outsole coverage and traction but also its overall lockdown feel and suredfootness. During our playtests, we enjoyed the mix of its full-length Air Strobel for our landings, and the wonderful court feel its low midsole offered. It gave us more control of our moves and we felt more confident in the court. Nevertheless, this shoe's cushioning might feel pretty dull, so we wouldn't go for it if you're looking for a responsive hooper!

And don't worry if you're new to Jay Tatum's signature hoopers, we believe you're gonna like them if you're looking for: A very durable pair to hoop, hoop, and keep hooping. Lots of court feel to perform aggressive moves. A solid lockdown feel to give you some extra confidence. A unique-retro style to flash when you're playing. Who should not buy During our wear tests, we've verified that this shoe underperforms in dusty courts. But that's not all, this model doesn't only pick up dust, it also holds on to it! Once the rubber of the outsole had warmed up, the traction of these Jordans improved; yet, if that's not enough for you or you tend to play in very dusty courts, then we believe you should have a look at the Giannis Immortality 2 . Your browser does not support the video tag. If you're looking for a fun shoe to play with, this isn't it. Its cushioning can feel rather dull, so don't expect much bounce. In that sense, we think you should have a look at the Adidas Dame Certified . It's an affordable pair with a nice mix of court feel and impact protection. Cushioning Heel stack At 26.6 mm according to our caliper, these Jordans stay pretty close to the ground. Even though this score is lower than average and than the one the v1 got, we didn't think it was a problem. Apart from reducing some extra weight, this new model has a full-length Air Strobel, which is terrific for comfort and cushioning. Even though its midsole is made of EVA, which is on the harder side, this extra Air bed made sure our landings were not that harsh. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Tatum 2 26.6 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack Following our durometer reading, the forefoot stack is average at 22.2 mm. We loved how this model offered a nice mix of ground feel and cushioning. We were able to perform dribbles that required an extra ounce of control, and at the same time our feet felt supported by the Air Strobel. Your browser does not support the video tag. The extra cushioning makes the shoe fit for aggressive jumps if you're going for a rebound. As you might know, sometimes you hit other players mid-air when you're trying to catch the ball. When a shoe's cushioning is not enough, the impact might be harsher on the user's joints, which is something we want to avoid. Test results Tatum 2 22.2 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop As the heel stack is lower in the v2, yet the forefoot stack of both models is pretty similar, there's a change in this shoe's drop compared to its predecessor. At 4.4 mm, the durable rubber of the outsole and the comfortable Air Strobel team up to offer you a closer-to-the-ground design. We really enjoyed this structure in our playtests, as we felt more in control compared to the previous version. We could perform the same cuts, dribbles, and fakes with no problem, but we felt more cushioned in our landings and safer overall. Test results Tatum 2 4.4 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. When our durometer returned 38.6 HA, we realised how the brand had totally changed its approach on the midsole too. It's fully made with EVA, which is not known for being super plush. Nevertheless, the full-length Air Strobel made sure we still felt comfortable during our wear tests. This piece offered cushioning in terms of shock absorption, but we can't say it's the most bouncy model we've tried so far. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Tatum 2 38.6 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Jordan Tatum 2 fits true to size (19 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit Having created a gel mold of the shoe's interiors, we measured its widest part at 92.1 mm. Slightly wider than average, it offers an accommodating fit. Your browser does not support the video tag. However, as you can see from the shape of the mold, the Tatum 2 gets notably narrower towards the front. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Tatum 2 92.1 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width With only 64.3 mm of width near the big toe, the shoe proved to be rather pointy. This limits its target audience to players with medium-to-narrow feet. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Tatum 2 64.2 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height The shoe's toebox gets shallower towards the toes too but, luckily, it doesn't get any lower than the standard 23.5 mm. Test results Tatum 2 23.5 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Flexibility / Stiffness Following the results of our torsional rigidity test, we did expect this shoe to be quite stiff. Your browser does not support the video tag. At 49.5N, our gauge gave us a higher score than the average, which is something we already knew. Why? Well, because during our wear tests we could feel this shoe didn't want to completely bend with our feet when we were running up and down the court. Our stride didn't feel as smooth as with the previous iteration of this shoe. We really liked this stiffer structure for our layups and cuts, as it gave us an overall more solid feel. Nevertheless, we didn't enjoy it that much for shooting. When you fake shoot or when you train shooting mechanics, your feet are constantly bent on the ball of the foot. Your browser does not support the video tag. It might sound redundant, but trust us: it does make a difference. This shoe follows methodology 1.8. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Tatum 2 49.5N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight The sturdier materials chosen for the v2 of this shoe came with some added weight. At 12.9 oz / 366.0g, this model is heavier than its predecessor, but it's still way lighter than average, so we didn't mind it. Our feet didn't feel dragged with it or anything like that. During our playtests, the Tatum 2's light nature helped us perform aggressive and quick moves. Nevertheless, its rigid structure (we'll talk about this later on in this review) didn't let us enjoy its lightweight that much. Test results Tatum 2 12.9 oz (366g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability For our breathability test, we use a smoke machine, a microscope, and a light. We start off by filling the shoe up with smoke, and then we patiently wait and see how, when, where, and how much of it actually manages to come out. Your browser does not support the video tag. Compared to the Under Armour Curry 10 , which scored a perfect 5/5 in this ventilation test, our Jordans couldn't let that much smoke out. Still, we could see a constant streak coming through the tongue, so we decided to give this model a 2/5. Your browser does not support the video tag. As we can see in our light test, this is mainly thanks to the multiple wholes its tongue has. They let the smoke come out much better than any other area in the shoe. The tightly woven material of these hoopers wouldn't be the one to smoothly allow the air to come in and out! Just look at how thick it is, the tongue definitely saved the day! Test results Tatum 2 2 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Lateral stability is a key feature of basketball shoes. If you've played this sport for long, you most likely know people who have sprained their ankles, or maybe it's happened even to you. That's why it's crucial for your feet and yourself to feel safe and locked in properly when you go for a new pair of hoopers. Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see in the video, our ankles didn't wobble during our wear tests. This was something that we enjoyed in the previous version too, but there has been a great update regarding the whole shoe's design. Now we can see a solid structure that offers support and surefootedness, which was our experience in our playtests. Once again, this was most likely a \"listen and learn\" experience for Jordan, as the previous version was way more unstable. In order to explain this a bit better, we're going to show you a picture of the Tatum 1. Can you see the small linear gap? With this shoe, the forefoot was fine, but the mid and the rearfoot didn't feel great to us. There was a strong lack of arch support, and overall we felt a bit unstable. This is something Jordan made sure was fixed for this new version. There's always room for improvement, though, but we feel the brand definitely listened to its customers complaints. Your browser does not support the video tag. Nice, Jordan! Keep it up for the v3! Torsional rigidity Earning the highest grade in our torsional rigidity test, the Jordan Tatum 2 made sure our feet felt safe with its solid and well-structured design. Your browser does not support the video tag. You can see our thumbs clearly struggling to bend the shoe. It felt like an armour for our feet! This is good news for those who appreciate foothold and lockdown, but having such a rigid structure definitely takes a toll on flexibility. We'll discuss this aspect later on, yet in the previous video you can already see this model doesn't bend easily in the ball of the foot. This made our transitions less smooth, but that's the price to pay, though! Your browser does not support the video tag. It's pretty clear in this example of us running down for a defensive balance. Can you see the toebox's lack of flexibility? Test results Tatum 2 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness Despite its whole structure being way more rigid than the previous version, the Tatum 2's heel counter stiffness remains the same. This part of the shoe is nicely padded, and we loved that. If you'd want it to have a snugger fit, you can always use the extra top eyelet this shoe has. That's what we did during our wear tests, and it helped our feet feel safer! Test results Tatum 2 3 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot At 113.5 mm, this shoe's midsole width in the forefoot is close to the average. Even though our caliper returned a number slightly lower than average, our standard-width feet didn't even realise. Test results Tatum 2 113.5 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel At 85.5 mm, our caliper told us that Jordan went for a snugger fit in the heel. We didn't experience any heel slippage during our playtests, which is something that we always appreciate. Test results Tatum 2 85.8 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability At the very same moment we took this shoe out of its box, we could already tell it was made to last. Our eyes didn't deceive us when our Dremel decided to pick up a fight and... lost it. Your browser does not support the video tag. We always put our tool in the same spot. This helps us keep our results coherent and comparable, which makes the grading system we use much easier to understand. As you can see in the picture, there's an extra layer protecting the textile of the toebox. Our Dremel made its way through it, but that was pretty much it. We were very happy with these Jordans' results, as they scored a well-deserved 4/5 in our toebox durability test. On the left we have our shoe, the Jordan Tatum 2, and its solid toebox. On the right, the Nike Precision 6 and its devastating 1/5 in our durability test! Compared to its predecessor, this shoe has improved its defensive system! (from 3/5 in the Tatum 1 to 4/5 in the Tatum 2). Test results Tatum 2 4 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability We're more than happy to tell you that this second version keeps improving. Our Dremel was ready for the next round, and this time we moved it all the way to the back to test the heel padding durability. Your browser does not support the video tag. Impressed by its armour-like nature once again, this shoe's materials were ready to withstand the rolling attack of our tool. Scoring a fantastic 4/5 in our heel padding durability test, the Tatum 2 is ready for the constant Achilles rubbing that this sport requires. You can easily see it in the picture. Our Dremel's attack didn't put the shoe's integrity at risk, and we loved it! On the other hand, the Answer DMX 's experience was much worse. You can see the material is all torn, and there's a considerable dent in the padding. That's why this Reebok couldn't get more than a 1/5 in our heel padding durability test. Test results Tatum 2 4 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness The approach Jordan used regarding the outsole is completely different from the previous version. Before we dive into this, let's compare our durometer results in the outsole hardness test we performed in the lab. At 86.1 HC, the Tatum 2's score is not only higher than average, but also an incredibly 29% harder than the Tatum 1's. This usually means a higher durability, as the material is more resistant to abrasive elements. Test results Tatum 2 86.1 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability As we were saying, this difference in the outsole has been absolutely game-changing. It looks like the brand listened to the users' complaints about this part of the shoe, and we couldn't be happier. If you don't have the Tatum 1 or you're not familiar with its outsole controversy, let us sum it up for you real quick with a picture and a couple of key points. This is what the Tatum 1's outsole looks like. As you can see, there are clearly two different materials: a big pink rubber pod and a white bed, which is the midsole's material. The thing with this outsole is that the pink part is very durable, as stated by our Dremel test, yet the white one... is lacking in this aspect. We performed the same test on both shoes. As usual, we grabbed our tool and went for the heel to measure the durability of its materials. Your browser does not support the video tag. It tried to make its way little by little, but the v2 of this model showed great resistance. It ended up with a dent of 0.8 mm, which is a far greater result than the one the v1 got. No words are needed, we'll just show you a picture of the damages the Dremel left in the Tatum 1 so you can see how big the difference is. Test results Tatum 2 0.8 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness At 3.1 mm, this shoe's outsole is thinner than average. We believe this is a fair decision coming from the brand. In other words, the outsole's material is hard enough for it not to be incredibly thick, and adding more mm would also add more oz/g to the overall weight of the shoe. Nice one, Jordan! Test results Tatum 2 3.1 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness At 5.0 mm, this shoe's insole is thicker than average, which makes it more comfortable. We loved this thick insole + Air Strobel combo, as it gave us some extra impact protection when we jumped for rebounds or when we performed aggressive layups. Test results Tatum 2 5.0 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole Removable insoles are something we'll never get tired of. The JT logo looks awesome! But what's even more important is that you can use your own orthotics with this shoe, which is always great news! If you need some specific features, you can always change the insole. We were pretty happy with this shoe's default insole, but you can easily remove it if you want to use your own orthotics. Test results Tatum 2 Yes Reflective elements Much like the Tatum 1, the Tatum 2 doesn't have any reflective elements. Test results Tatum 2 No Tongue padding The tongue padding is also different from the previous version. At 9.7 mm, it's thicker than average, and an incredibly 1.7 mm thicker than the v1's. We didn't feel any kind of lace bite or uncomfortableness. The padded design of the tongue made us feel cozy and protected during our wear tests, as we could tie our shoes tighter without getting hurt from lace rubbing. Test results Tatum 2 9.7 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type We absolutely loved the Tatum 2's fully gusseted tongue. The lockdown feel and containment were great, and thanks to the lace in the middle of the tongue it didn't slip away. We really appreciated these two key points in our playtests, as they improved the supportive feel and we could go for more aggressive moves. Your browser does not support the video tag. The cherry on top is the padded interior of this model, look! Your browser does not support the video tag. There's a substantial amount of padding in the collar, which hugged our heels snuggly and comfortably. The top eyelet was the final touch, our ankles felt pretty happy with this fit! Test results Tatum 2 Both sides (full) Heel tab This shoe doesn't include any kind of heel tab. Honestly, its back design with the Jordan logo is so cool that a finger loop would not add extra points to its aesthetics. We loved the colour contrast on this one. The Jumpman looked sick in that black background. Talk about stylish!

Even though it doesn't scream performance, the shoe has all the basics and we recommend it for players who are only trying their hand at basketball. Considering that you can get this shoe with a good discount these days, it is practically a free pair of entry-level kicks! And if it doesn't work for basketball, you can still wear this looker out and about.

Your browser does not support the video tag. So, if you are willing to stretch your basketball shoe budget by another $30-40, you can get a solid pair of much higher quality. We recommend having a look at the PUMA Court Rider or the Jordan Luka 1 as an alternative to the Lockdown 6. Cushioning Heel stack When it comes to cushioning, the Lockdown 6 is the most average hoop shoe you can imagine. Every single midsole parameter we measured in this UA shoe corresponds to the average of our lab-tested basketball shoes. Your browser does not support the video tag. The heel stack height comes in at 29 mm, which is the same as the average. That doesn't mean bad though! It translates into pretty sufficient impact protection upon landing. Test results Lockdown 6 29.0 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack In the forefoot, the caliper shows 21.9 mm. This stack height gave us enough cushioning under the toes while still maintaining sufficient court feel. Test results Lockdown 6 21.9 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop At 7.1 mm, the heel-to-toe drop also turns out to be the same as the average. We consider it as the optimal heel elevation which keeps the landings safe but doesn't compromise connection to the ground. Test results Lockdown 6 7.1 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. Like most basketball shoes, the UA Lockdown 6 uses a firmer foam for cushioning. Measuring its softness with a durometer returned 30.5 HA. But what makes this shoe different from the more expensive models is that it uses a basic EVA foam. This material doesn't have any exciting characteristics like springiness or bounce and feels pretty dull underfoot. Your browser does not support the video tag. If you crave a better energy return for jumps, it's better to invest in the top-tier Curry Flow 10 shoe . Test results Lockdown 6 30.5 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Under Armour Lockdown 6 fits slightly small (21 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit For our medium-width feet, we have no complaints regarding the shoe's fit. The toebox offered the right amount of space for our toes to splay and feel at home. Measuring the widest part of the toebox with a caliper, we got 95.9 mm, which is a couple of millimeters narrower than average. However, this was not a problem given that the rest of the toebox remained on the wide side. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Lockdown 6 95.9 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width At the big-toe mark, we measured the width of the toebox at 79.5 mm. That's a little wider than average. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Lockdown 6 79.5 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Flexibility / Stiffness There is not a lot of give in the shoe's platform but it's not stiffer than the average either. Measuring how much force it takes to bend the shoe to a 90-degree angle, our gauge returned 38.5N. That's about the same as it took our lab-tested basketball shoes on average. Whether that's good or bad news depends on each player's personal preference. Some enjoy a more flexible ride as it gives more control during agile movements, while others rely on stiffer platforms for stability and quicker turnovers. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Lockdown 6 38.5N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight On the scale, the UA Lockdown 6 shows 13.1 oz (371g) in a men's US size 9. That's about half an ounce lighter than average and is a nice surprise considering the shoe's synthetic leather upper. Test results Lockdown 6 13.1 oz (371g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability With its synthetic leather upper and minimal ventilation holes, the Lockdown 6 is not a very breathable shoe. As our smoke-pumping test proves, the air is only able to escape through the mesh material on the tongue. For that reason, we rated this UA shoe's breathability with a low score of 2 out of 5. Your browser does not support the video tag. And as you can see from our transparency test below, even the mesh panels on the sides don't seem to be very functional either. Your browser does not support the video tag. If breathability is important to you, have a look at the Nike Precision 6 . It is a much better aerated alternative at the same price point. Test results Lockdown 6 2 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Given the shoe's price point, we kept our expectations low when testing the stability of the UA Lockdown 6. And it actually wasn't that bad. Your browser does not support the video tag. In our opinion, the shoe provides an essential amount of support for someone who is just starting out with the sport. But if you have weak ankles or need more supportive shoes in general, we recommend investing in shoes like the Adidas Dame 8 or the PUMA MB.02 . Your browser does not support the video tag. Torsional rigidity In a manual assessment, we found that the Lockdown 6 is pretty easy to twist. Maybe even a little too easy for a basketball shoe. We rated the shoe's torsional rigidity as only 3  out of 5 whereas the average is 4.5. Your browser does not support the video tag. For comparison, here is what a stiffer platform looks like on the PUMA MB.02 (stiffness score: 4). Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Lockdown 6 3 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness Besides torsional flexibility, this UA shoe also lacks stiffness in the heel counter. Squeezing and pushing the back of the shoe revealed how pliable it is. On a 1-5 scale where 5 is the stiffest, we rated it as only 2. On the court, it translated to a weaker heel hold and more ankle wobbling. Test results Lockdown 6 2 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot On a lighter note, the UA Lockdown 6 has an amply wide platform which helps to keep the landings stable. In the widest area of the forefoot, we measured the sole at 112.2 mm - same as the average of our tested hoop shoes. Test results Lockdown 6 112.2 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel Back in the heel, the caliper shows 91.3 mm in the widest part. It is a solid heel width for a proper basketball shoe. Test results Lockdown 6 91.3 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability The upside of synthetic leather is that it levels up the shoe's upper durability quite a bit. It even helped the Lockdown 6 to surpass some of the more expensive hoop shoes! We used a Dremel to test the shoe's capacity to resist abrasion. After drilling the toebox for 12 seconds at the speed of 10K RPM, the damage was very surface-level. This gained the shoe a solid 4 out of 5 for toebox durability. Test results Lockdown 6 4 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability Another part of the shoe that sustained the Dremel challenge was the heel padding. Even though there is no leather here, the textile proved to be pretty hard-wearing. Four seconds of drilling only resulted in a small scuff. This convinced us to rate the durability of this part as 4 out of 5. Test results Lockdown 6 4 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness Another pleasant surprise was the outsole. For such a cheap shoe, the UA Lockdown 6 uses a pretty hard rubber compound. Pressing a durometer against it gave us a reading of 80.1 HC. That's the same hardness we see in many expensive hoop shoes. Based on this measurement and our own experience, it is one of the few cheap shoes that we can recommend for outdoor play. Test results Lockdown 6 80.1 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole thickness The shoe also has a sufficient amount of rubber to withstand wear and tear. Our caliper shows 3.5 mm of thickness in the outsole. Test results Lockdown 6 3.5 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness The shoe uses a fairly standard insole to complete the cushioning. It has an average thickness of 4.4 mm. Test results Lockdown 6 4.4 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole The insole is removable, allowing you to wear a different kind of insert or a custom orthotic if needed. Test results Lockdown 6 Yes Tongue padding The tongue has a pretty standard amount of padding in it. Using a caliper, we measured its thickness at 8.1 mm. Test results Lockdown 6 8.1 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type The UA Lockdown 6 uses a standard tongue that's separate from the upper.

We think that it will be most appreciated by the following: quick and shifty guards hoopers looking for a stable and supportive low-top beginner-intermediate players who want the best value for money Who should NOT buy The Adidas D.O.N. Issue #4 is not the best option for the bigger players who need a lot of cushioning or a pair that lasts long. These athletes are better off with the Harden Vol. 7 , which is also from Adidas Basketball . Your browser does not support the video tag. Another major complaint is that the Lightstrike foam on this basketball shoe feels dull compared to other foams from Adidas. If this is a concern for you, we recommend the Adidas Dame 8 (Bounce Pro foam) or the Adidas Trae Young 2 (Boost foam). Cushioning Heel stack The D.O.N. Issue #4 features a pretty standard amount of cushioning which shows in our caliper readings too. At 29.5 mm, the shoe's heel stack sits right at the average of basketball shoes. Test results D.O.N. Issue #4 29.5 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack There is also a fairly average amount of stack height in the shoe's forefoot. Showing 20.5 mm on the caliper, it is nearly the same as the average. Test results D.O.N. Issue #4 20.5 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop Looking at the difference in stack heights, we get a heel-to-toe drop of 9.0 mm. As boring as it sounds, it is also close to the average of hoop shoes. On the court, this translates into a pretty good balance of impact protection and court feel. The shoe's heel is not overly raised, while the forefoot cushioning is sufficient for those who stay on their toes the entire game. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results D.O.N. Issue #4 9.0 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. The Adidas D.O.N. Issue #4 features one of the brand's renowned foams - the Lightstrike. Of course, we had to check how soft it was with the help of our trusted durometer. The tool returned 27.3 HA which is very close to the average but still a little firmer (by 3%). On foot, the shoe's cushioning indeed felt quite firm. This is not at all surprising if we take a look at our durometer measurements for the Boost and Bounce Pro foams in other shoes: Adidas Harden Vol. 7 (Boost): 11.0 HA - 148% softer Adidas Dame 8 (Bounce Pro): 20.3 HA - 34% softer Your browser does not support the video tag. The Lightstrike foam is meant to be firmer and more stable than the rest of Adidas' foams. But on the downside, it lacks the same plushness and energy return. So, to us, it felt rather dull and even somewhat old-school. Test results D.O.N. Issue #4 27.3 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Adidas D.O.N. Issue #4 fits slightly small (20 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit As someone with medium-width feet, we experienced no issues with the Adidas D.O.N. Issue #4's fit. Measuring the shoe's toebox at the widest part, we got 102.7 mm which is an average width for a basketball shoe. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results D.O.N. Issue #4 102.7 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width Also, at the big toe, we measured the width at 77.7 mm which is again, an average measurement across hoop shoes. This Adidas shoe doesn't taper much around the forefoot, saving toes from being cramped. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results D.O.N. Issue #4 77.7 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Flexibility / Stiffness Wearing the D.O.N. Issue #4, we experienced really nice and smooth heel-to-toe transitions. It seems like this is due to the smooth curvatures on both ends as well as the shoe's pretty flexible build. Your browser does not support the video tag. To test the shoe's flexibility, we bent it to a 90-degree angle while holding a force gauge against the sole. The latter showed how much force it took to get the shoe that far. In the case of this Adidas shoe, it required 30N which is 36% less than average! Your browser does not support the video tag. The Issue #4 is definitely among the most pliable basketball shoes we've tested. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results D.O.N. Issue #4 29.9N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight As a shoe that's meant for guards with an agile playing style, the Adidas D.O.N. Issue #4 comes in a lighter-than-average weight. Tipping the scale at 13.5 oz (383g), this Adidas shoe turns out to be slightly below average (by 0.7 oz). But if you look for something even lighter, you can't go wrong with the Under Armour Curry 10 (12.6 oz/358g). Test results D.O.N. Issue #4 13.5 oz (383g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability Phew! That's one really stuffy shoe! Honestly, the D.O.N. Issue #4 made us feel like we were wearing a waterproof hiking boot. To convey our experience through a lab test, we pumped some smoke through the shoe's upper. As you can see from the video below, there is absolutely no smoke/air passing through the toebox! Your browser does not support the video tag. Only a tiny streak of vapor is able to escape from the gap between the tongue and the upper edge. This is obviously not enough to keep your feet ventilated and fresh on a warm summer day. Thus, we gave this Adidas shoe the lowest breathability score: 1 out of 5. And just to be 100% sure, let's have a transparency check. Holding the shoe's upper half over bright light makes it absolutely clear that there are no hidden ventilation holes or breathable mesh panels. Your browser does not support the video tag. Finally, we gave the shoe one last shot by turning to our trusty microscope. Looking at the incredibly tightly woven threads leaves no doubt - the Adidas D.O.N. Issue #4 is hot as hell! Test results D.O.N. Issue #4 1 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Playtesting this Donovan Mitchell shoe, we experienced plenty of support and stability during lateral movements. As you can see from the video below, the shoe does not allow our ankles to roll inwards so easily. For a low-top shoe, that's an impressive amount of ankle support. It is in fact one of the shoe's stronger aspects. Torsional rigidity Among the key contributors to the shoe's stability is of course the shank plate embedded into the midsole. We felt how well it prevented the shoe from twisting and folding too much. As you can see from our manual test below, twisting this Adidas shoe with our bare hands doesn't come so easily. On a 1-5 scale, where 5 is the stiffest, we rated the Issue #4's torsional rigidity with the maximum score of 5. Test results D.O.N. Issue #4 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness We were amazed at the shoe's ability to create a pliable yet highly supportive heel collar. In our manual test of the shoe's heel counter stiffness, we found it to be more on the flexible side. This convinced us to give it only 2 out of 5 for stiffness. But worry not! There is so much padding around the ankle that heel slips are not known to this Adidas shoe. Test results D.O.N. Issue #4 2 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot In addition to having a firm and stable midsole with a fair amount of rigidity, the shoe also features an amply wide base. Measuring the platform in the widest part of its forefoot, we got 113 mm on the caliper. This is exactly the same as the average across hoop shoes. Test results D.O.N. Issue #4 113.0 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The D.O.N. Issue #4 also has a solid amount of width in the heel. Measuring the widest part, we got 90.2 mm which is also very close to the average. Having such a reasonably wide landing area helped us feel quite confident and surefooted. Especially when rapid movements and direction changes were necessary. Test results D.O.N. Issue #4 90.2 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Lockdown Alongside the shoe's stability, we believe that foot containment is another great strength of the Adidas D.O.N. Issue #4. In our opinion, the extra eyelets are really underrated in the basketball realm. For us, the shoe's extra eyelets turned out to be the difference-makers as far as preventing heel slippage is concerned. Once this Adidas shoe was fully laced up, we felt absolutely covered for all kinds of moves, quick ones in particular. Durability Toebox durability The airflow doesn't come easy for the D.O.N. Issue #4, but neither does abrasion! Its woven upper material is nearly bulletproof as far as basketball shoes go. Putting it through our most demanding durability test, we held the Dremel against the shoe's toebox for 12 seconds at a consistent force (3.2N) and speed (5K RPM). And what did we get? The tool only damaged the topmost fabric layer! We're happy to say that it didn't even get halfway through. Your browser does not support the video tag. That way, on a 1-5 scale, the Issue #4 receives a well-deserved score of 4 for toebox durability. For context, let us compare this Adidas shoe's upper to a textile upper from Nike. The difference here is immense! But so is the price difference (Adidas is $45 pricier!). Adidas D.O.N. Issue #4 vs. Nike Precision 6 Test results D.O.N. Issue #4 4 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability Even the shoe's heel padding stood strong against the Dremel! Your browser does not support the video tag. In an unequal battle that lasted 4 seconds, we saw only minor scuffing on the D.O.N. Issue #4's collar lining. With such an impressive result, we again, granted this Adidas shoe a high durability score of 4 out of 5. Test results D.O.N. Issue #4 4 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness Checking the hardness of rubber at the bottom of the Issue #4, we also found it to be 4% firmer than average. That is usually a sign of higher abrasion resistance too. And just like that, we had our hopes high for the shoe's outsole durability. Test results D.O.N. Issue #4 84.5 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability But, to our disappointment, the outsole only showed average durability. It's not terrible but there is nothing to write home about either. Your browser does not support the video tag. First, we drilled the rubber for 22 seconds at a relentless speed of 10K RPM and then measured the dent with a tread gauge. Turned out that the damage was 1.4 mm deep which is about the same as the average 1.1 mm. Our primary concern here is that the treads are so thin that we cannot wholeheartedly recommend the shoe for outdoor use. As you can see, they get shredded pretty easily which will result in loss of grip pretty early on. Test results D.O.N. Issue #4 1.4 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness Another factor that makes this shoe less appropriate for outdoor games is that its outsole is a millimeter thinner than average. Our caliper shows 3.0 mm which could be a problem combined with the results of the Dremel test above. Test results D.O.N. Issue #4 3.0 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness Buffering the firmness of the midsole is a well-padded insole. Using a caliper, we measured it to be 4.1 mm under the heel which is an average thickness for basketball shoes. Test results D.O.N. Issue #4 4.1 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole The shoe's insole can be effortlessly removed and swapped for a different kind of insert or orthotic. Test results D.O.N. Issue #4 Yes Tongue padding The Issue #4's tongue is also quite generously padded reaching 11.2 mm in the thickest part. This is actually a couple of millimeters thicker than average. We thoroughly enjoyed the interior comfort provided by this Adidas shoe. The whole experience felt super cozy and pampering. You can see how the shoe's collar is also well padded around the ankle. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results D.O.N. Issue #4 11.2 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type The shoe's tongue is semi-gusseted, or partially attached, on the sides. This made it feel considerably more secure on te foot and sliding was never an issue. Test results D.O.N. Issue #4 Both sides (semi) Heel tab There is no heel tab on the D.O.N. Issue #4 but we didn't feel it lacking. Because the tongue is only semi-gusseted, the shoe mouth opened wide enough to let the foot in easily. Test results D.O.N.

It is undoubtedly one of the most collectible basketball shoes we have ever tested, being highly comfortable, firm, and resistant to bottoming out. Since this shoe is modeled after a big man like Shaquille O’Neal, we found it suitable for big men and players who play the center position.

It is going to be a good pick for you are looking for a shoe that offers the following: a cushioning system that does not bottom out so soon, especially in the heel area features and functions that suit the playing style of a typical center an amazingly firm outsole that contributes to speed and control a worthy homage to Shaquille O’Neal Who should NOT buy This basketball shoe from Reebok is not for those who want a well-ventilated pair. The upper of this shoe just does not breathe at all. We discovered that players are better off getting the Reebok Question Mid . Your browser does not support the video tag. Those players who want lighter basketball shoes may not find this shoe satisfying. Other Reebok shoes are also known to be weighty. If you are willing to try a shoe from another brand, we recommend the Nike LeBron 20 as it's just as well-cushioned yet 2 ounces lighter. There is an even lighter version called the LeBron NXXT GEN . Cushioning Heel stack The midsole of the Shaq Attaq surely felt elevated, especially around the heel area. Using a caliper, we learned that the heel stack is way higher than average at 37.2 mm. The thick heel prevented the shoe from bottoming down way too soon, even when we did a lot of aggressive heel strikes. Test results Shaq Attaq 37.2 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack The forefoot stack is just of average height. We measured it to be 22.4 mm high. It's important to note here that the significant difference between the thickness of the forefoot and the heel allowed us to perceptually experience the forefoot as having more court feel. Test results Shaq Attaq 22.4 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop A high heel stack coupled with an average forefoot stack resulted in an especially high drop. Our caliper measured it to be 14.8 mm. This setup was practically appealing to us because of our propensity to do a lot of heel strikes, especially when the games turn a little intense. Test results Shaq Attaq 14.8 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. The softness of the midsole is just around average, and we did not experience any significant issues with it. It delivered impact protection when needed, but the experience was not as amazing as what the Nike LeBron 20 could deliver. Your browser does not support the video tag. Our HA durometer gave it a rating of 25.9. Test results Shaq Attaq 25.9 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Reebok Shaq Attaq fits true to size (24 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit At its widest part, the toebox is 105.5 mm wide. This figure is significantly higher than average. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Shaq Attaq 105.5 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width However, we still couldn't recommend this shoe to wide-footers because it tapers quite aggressively toward the tip. The toebox is only 73.5 mm wide at the big toe. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Shaq Attaq 73.5 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Flexibility / Stiffness Using a digital force gauge, we learned that the Shaq Attaq needs 40.3N of force so it can be bent at 90 degrees. Its flexibility does not deviate much from the average. Not too flimsy, not too constricting and rigid. This was how we experienced this kind of structure. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Shaq Attaq 40.3N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight Though it did not feel like a brick on our feet, we still felt the Shaq Attaq weighing down our first steps. Our in-lab weighing scale showed that it is indeed on the heavier side at 16.7 ounces or 473 grams. Much like the athlete behind this shoe, it is one of the heaviest hoop shoes we've ever tested in our lab! It is more than 2.5 oz heftier than average. Test results Shaq Attaq 16.7 oz (473g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability Getting only a 1 out of 5 in our breathability assessments, the Reebok Shaq Attaq is among the hottest (quite literally) shoes out there. Your browser does not support the video tag. Both smoke and light find it hard to pass through the upper material. Your browser does not support the video tag. We did a close examination of the upper through the microscope. We saw that it doesn't have any perforations that would have allowed air to pass through. The upper just looks like one solid mass that keeps all out, including air. Those with sweaty feet should prepare for a deluge. Test results Shaq Attaq 1 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test We felt our side-to-side movements to be sufficiently supported by this Reebok shoe. The sidewalls prevented our feet from shifting excessively without sacrificing comfort and freedom of movement. Torsional rigidity While playing, not once did we even think about twisting our feet. We also appreciated how stable our runs were. We did manual twists on the Reebok Shaq Attaq back in the lab, and we gave it a 4 out of 5 for torsional rigidity. Test results Shaq Attaq 4 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness Admittedly, the heel counter is not the stiffest that we've ever tested. Fortunately, this observation does not mean that it's flimsy and unreliable. It provided enough support to keep the rearfoot in place. After giving it a nice squeeze in the lab, we gave the heel counter a 3 out of 5 for stiffness. It is only slightly more pliable than the average. Test results Shaq Attaq 3 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot The midsole platform of this shoe provided a bit of extra space in the forefoot. Using a caliper, we found this area to be slightly wider than average at 116.9 mm. Its width allowed our feet to splay freely during takeoffs. Test results Shaq Attaq 116.9 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The width of the heel area is just around the average at 89.0 mm, which did not pose any issue because the forefoot already provided the width that we needed (and actually enjoyed). Test results Shaq Attaq 89.0 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability The non-breathable upper surely did not come totally empty-handed: it offered tremendous durability. We did the Dremel test on it, and it was just child's play for the toebox of the Reebok Shaq Attaq! Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see, the damage incurred by the Reebok Shaq Attaq, which got a perfect 5, is much less than the damage seen on the Harden Stepback 3 from Adidas , which only got a 3 out of 5 from us. Reebok Shaq Attaq (5 out of 5) vs Adidas Harden Stepback 3 (3 out of 5) Test results Shaq Attaq 5 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability The heel padding is also amazingly sturdy. Just like the toebox, this part of the shoe got a perfect 5 for durability. Your browser does not support the video tag. As can be seen in the closeup shot blow, our Dremel drilling into it barely left a mark. Test results Shaq Attaq 5 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness Based on the readings made by our HC durometer, the hardness of the outsole is significantly higher than average. Our durometer returned a reading of 88.7 HC. This firmness of the sole allowed us to gain more control over our movements. We also enjoyed how it helped us accelerate easily. Test results Shaq Attaq 88.7 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability In spite of being hard/firm, the outsole did not fare any better than average in our durability test. Our 22-second Dremel drilling created 1.0 mm of damage. We acknowledge that this is not the best pick for outdoor use (the Nike Cosmic Unity 3 is!), but we still believe that using this shoe outdoors from time to time won't hurt. Test results Shaq Attaq 1.0 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness Our caliper measurements showed that the outsole of the Reebok Shaq Attaq has an outsole that is slightly thicker than average. Specifically, we measured it to be 4.8 mm thick. Logically, the thicker sole allows this shoe to last longer even with occasional outdoor use simply because there is more material to 'burn.' Test results Shaq Attaq 4.8 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness The insole is slightly thicker than the average insole at 4.8 mm, and we appreciated how spongy it felt underfoot. Test results Shaq Attaq 4.8 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole The insole was removable. So it was quite easy to free up some space whenever we needed to wear orthotics. Test results Shaq Attaq Yes Tongue padding At 9.0 mm, the padding in the tongue is just about as thick as the average. Test results Shaq Attaq 9.0 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type This Reebok shoe's non-gusseted design allowed us to move more freely. It also made tongue adjustments a bit easier. Test results Shaq Attaq None Heel tab There was no heel tab, and this is OK. We did not have problems wearing or taking off the shoe, anyway.

But if you're more of a heavy player and need that extra impact protection for your rebounds, we suggest you try the Nike Lebron 20 . Your browser does not support the video tag. If you're looking for an economic pair that will be your teammate for a while, we think you should go for the durable Nike Ja 1 . Cushioning Heel stack If you love basketball as much as we do, you probably already know that cushioning is a key feature your shoes must have. We need our landing to be as safe as possible, protecting our knees and ankles from any potential injury. So we KNOW you're gonna love the fact that the Harden Stepback 3 has a higher heel stack than average! It's just 5% though, so if you're a big player (in every single aspect of the word) or your joints tend to hurt and you're looking for something more plush for your jumps, we recommend the Reebok Question Mid . Test results Harden Stepback 3 31.5 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack When we measured the forefoot stack, our caliper showed 21.0 mm. This is just slightly lower than the category's average, but don't worry, the ball of your feet will be protected from any impacts when you go for a rebound! Test results Harden Stepback 3 21.0 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop The Adidas Harden Stepback 3 makes 2vs1 sound easy. The heel-to-toe difference in this pair is 10.5 mm. We were pretty impressed by this, as it's 21% higher than the average! But... what does this actually mean? Well, as the stack height at the front part is slightly lower than average, the ground feel is a bit better. Your browser does not support the video tag. At the same time, this difference shows that your heel will land happily every time you jump. Great combo, Adidas! Test results Harden Stepback 3 10.5 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. But... alright, we admit it. This is not the most plush basketball shoe out there. Our durometer had something to say about this, but so do we! With a score of 21.6 HA, the Harden Stepback's midsole softness is lower than average. Yet, when we played ball with it on, we did not feel like that at all! Our feet were comfortable and protected, and our knees did not ask even once for some mercy! If you're still looking for a pair with a softer cushioning that won't cost you an arm and a leg (maybe just one hand, though), have a look at the Jordan Luka 1 .

But wait, wait. Let's build up expectations. Before we say anything to you, just have a look at this video: Your browser does not support the video tag. What we're doing is using a gauge to measure how much force it takes to bend the shoe to a 90-degree angle. And it doesn't seem like it's putting a lot of effort, right? Turns out it was just 38.2N! Even though this is lower than average, we know from previous tests that this pair is not the Nadia Comăneci of basketball shoes. So, wow! Great surprise! This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below.

Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight When we put this shoe on our scale, we realised it's almost 20 g heavier than average with its 14.9 oz (422.0g)! To be honest, most Harden's shoes aren't what we'd call featherlight, so we weren't that surprised. Test results Harden Stepback 3 14.9 oz (422g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability We started the Adidas Harden Stepback 3's big lab day with our breathability test. With our smoke-pumping machine, we check the shoe's breathability by the amount of smoke that goes through its upper. Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see, not much is coming out. Feeling a bit toasty, aren't we? Basketball shoes are normally not as well-ventilated as we would think. Thing is, if you want them to last, you'll need to use sturdy materials in their design. This usually means that you'll have to sacrifice some breathability for durability. Your browser does not support the video tag. By using a bright light, we can see if the shoe has some holes or pores that would let that light, as well as some air, come through. But... we're afraid you're the one who's gotta be flashy here, pal! Zero transparency! We used our microscope to look at its material closely. Check how tightly woven it is! In conclusion, we've decided to give it a 2/5, which is pretty close to the average. If you don't want your feet to become the Niagara Falls after hours and hours of playing, have a look at the breathable Nike Lebron Witness 7 . It scored a wonderful 4/5 on this same test! Test results Harden Stepback 3 2 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Another key part of basketball shoes: stability. This is a low-top pair, which meant our ankles moved freely to perform back-door cuts or change-of-pace dribbles. Still, it's really important that our feet feel safe. And, honestly, they did! Even though that extra lace you can see at the side heel is just for aesthetic purposes, the lace-up closure of this shoe kept our feet locked in comfortably. Your browser does not support the video tag. Despite not being a high or mid-top pair, the Adidas Harden Stepback 3 gave us the confidence we needed in our step. And it wasn't only the laces, its tight fit helped a lot too! Torsional rigidity As stiff as a good block, the Harden Stepback 3 got a 5/5 on our torsional rigidity test! We tried bending, twisting, squeezing, and everything in between. But nope! It refused to do so! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Harden Stepback 3 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness Are you familiar with the term pick and roll in basketball? If so, the stiffness difference of this shoe regarding torsional rigidity and heel counter could easily be explained by that. In other words, once you block (you stand still) you roll over with your hand up to get a pass (smooth moves again). So even though the Harden Stepback got a perfect score on its torsional rigidity test, it got a 2/5 on the heel counter stiffness one. Your browser does not support the video tag. The meaning of this? Well, the overall structure of the shoe will protect your feet from getting hurt, and the plushness of the heel will make you forget about hot spots and blisters. Time out talk: Even though this figure is lower than average, we did not feel there would be any heel slippage or any of the kind. Back to the game! Test results Harden Stepback 3 2 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot A wider midsole equals a wider platform to land. This also means that you'll feel more confident when jumping, which sums up our experience playing with this shoe pretty well! We measured the widest part of the midsole at the forefoot at 117.0 mm, so it's wider than average! We really felt surefooted with these baddies on. Test results Harden Stepback 3 117.0 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel Following the forefoots path, the width in the heel is also higher than average. At 96.4 mm, we felt the platform of this shoe was wonderful. But this does not only mean that the shoe accommodates wide feet. Let us tell you that, after playing for some time in the sun, our feet started swelling. This is totally normal, though, but if your foot grows, you'll obviously need a wider surface for it, right? Thanks to the Harden Stepback 3, we felt ready for anything even after some time playing. Jump ball, ref! Test results Harden Stepback 3 96.4 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability As we've seen in the previous category, this shoe's breathability is slightly lower than average. And... does that mean that it's a sturdy pair, then? Well, not quite! By just looking at the first seconds of this video of our Dremel going all out in the toebox, we can see how the materials start flying around! Your browser does not support the video tag. And not in the cool Michael Jordan 5-meter jump dunk it in typa fly, more in the \"get this thing away from me\" way of flying! As we can see, there is some damage, but it's actually not thaaaaat bad. Adidas Harden Stepback 3 (right) vs. Adidas Trae Young 2 (left) Okay, okay, its toe box isn't as durable as the Trae Young 2 's. But, to be fair, the Harden Stepback 3 is also way cheaper! 50 dollars even! So a 3/5 in our toebox durability test doesn't sound that bad anymore, huh? Test results Harden Stepback 3 3 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability Not strong at the front, and... not very strong at the back either! Your browser does not support the video tag. After seeing the one-to-one attack our Dremel pulled off on the Harden Stepback 3, we closed our eyes and called for Kawhi Leonard to help with the defense! We had to give this shoe a mere 2/5 in our heel padding durability test. Uh-oh! Test results Harden Stepback 3 2 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness But Harden is not the one to give up, and neither are his shoes! This pair came back stronger with its sole. Using a durometer to check its hardness, we found that it's way higher than many other hoop models. With a promising score of 85.5 HC, its hard-wear outsole is here to save the day! Also, as we can see in the picture, the rubber from the sole comes up all the way up to the sides of the shoe. Not only protecting its foam, but also our feet! Point guards will absolutely love this when the coach calls for a one-on-one defense, and shooting guards will definitely find it useful to avoid extending their stance in the offence. The sole's material is grippy enough to keep you on your feet even if you need to do extra quick moves like those. Work hard, play hard! Test results Harden Stepback 3 85.5 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability Wait up, wait up... We might not actually need to ask \"The Claw\" for help in our defense strategy. When we performed our outsole durability test and went full offensive with our Dremel, we were absolutely flabbergasted with the results. Your browser does not support the video tag. 22 seconds of constant damage here. And the Hard Stepback 3's outsole is like: \"Sorry, did you call?\". Our tread gauge showed 0.2 mm of damage when the average is around 1 mm. We're trying to stay calm here, but listen up. Not even some specific mountain models are THAT strong. The Harden Stepback 3? Yeah, easy peasy. Basically unbothered. Do you think this what Shaq feels when you bump into him? Test results Harden Stepback 3 0.2 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness Before we move on, let's not forget we're talking about an affordable pair of basketball shoes here! When we measured this shoe's outsole with a caliper, we found it to be lower than average at 3.6 mm. Even though this would mean that the shoe would not be the best for outdoor use, its outsole hardness and durability might let you enjoy some hoops in the sun. When we went balling to an outdoor court, we did not feel the sole was specifically weak or about to break. It let us enjoy some cool free shots out there too. Game on, Harden Stepback 3! Test results Harden Stepback 3 3.6 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness Padded insoles usually add some extra cushioning to the shoe. At 3.8 mm... this pair's insole is slightly thinner than average. So no extra plush here, our caliper says! You might think this is bad news. But what if we told you that this translates into a better ground feel? Not so bad anymore, huh? Test results Harden Stepback 3 3.8 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole Remember we mentioned before that this shoe sacrifices plushness in order to get some extra ground feel? If you wanna change that, you can just use custom orthotics with it. The Adidas Harden Stepback 3 has a removable insole! Test results Harden Stepback 3 Yes Tongue padding Even though the padding of the Harden Stepback 3's tongue got a lower score than average, we didn't feel any tongue bits or hotspots when we were having fun in the court. You might see this as a disadvantage, but let's think about it twice. In the previous tests, this shoe got a lower-than-average breathability but a higher-than-average weight. In fact, if you recheck the video of this first test, you can see that the smoke is actually coming out from the shoe in the tongue section. So, in order to keep things balanced, its designer probably decided to include less padding in the tongue. Smart move, Adidas! Test results Harden Stepback 3 8.3 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type The tongue of this shoe is what we call bootie type. It's attached to the sides but not all the way up, and it has a loop in the middle to offer a lock-in feel. Even though it's not an incredibly padded tongue, it hugs your feet comfortably and it doesn't move around. We can see the different loops, as we mentioned before, right in the middle of the tongue and a little bit up, and on the sides and at the beginning of the toebox. Apart from being very stylish, these pieces will also make sure the shoe's laces wrap around your fit nicely and safely. Test results Harden Stepback 3 Bootie Heel tab This shoe has 2 finger loops at the back. Even though the small one is there probably just to look cute (and it really does) we've found this very helpful. Like, imagine your feet are already swollen because of the heat. Or worse... you're late for training and that means you gotta run suicide drills. You're most likely thinking: \"Oh, please, no. Just no, anything but that!\". Anyone who has tried that exercise knows how incredibly exhausting it is. So, even though this pair has a big opening, that might not be enough to put it on in a rush. This is where the finger loop shines! Hurry up, put your feet inside, and start pulling. Let's make running out of time also running away from punishments!

Those who like comfortable fancy stuff are better off with the PUMA RS Dreamer or the Clyde All-Pro. These basketball shoes are signature offers, so we can expect them to be made of materials that not only feel nice but also look so good. Your browser does not support the video tag. In our opinion, bigger athletes in need of more impact protection are not going to enjoy the PUMA Court Rider. Shoes like the PUMA Rise Nitro and the PUMA MB.02 provide a much more generous helping of cushioning. Cushioning Heel stack On paper, the heel stack height of the PUMA Court Rider is 30.2 mm, which is the same as most basketball shoes tested in our lab. However, because of the four hollows embedded under the heel, the shoe feels much more grounded. As the hollows compress, the shoe gets closer to the ground, offering plenty of court feel. For that reason, we think that this basketball shoe is great for s maller and lighter guards who are often quick on their feet and do a lot of agile footwork. Impact protection is not this shoe's forte. Test results Court Rider 30.2 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack In the forefoot, we measured the cushioning thickness at 21 mm. It is an average stack height for basketball shoes and doesn't interfere with the shoe's court feel. Test results Court Rider 21.0 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop Because of the shoe's dynamic cushioning, its heel-to-toe drop is prone to changing as well. Being 9.2 mm in its \"resting state,\" we assume that it gets a few millimeters smaller under the body weight. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Court Rider 9.2 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. The PUMA Court Rider felt pretty bouncy and responsive throughout our playtest. This is partially due to the firm nature of its foam. Your browser does not support the video tag. Using a durometer, we measured the foam at 30.4 HA, which is 9% firmer than the average. This is also a contributing factor to the shoe's excellent ground contact. Test results Court Rider 30.4 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size PUMA Court Rider fits slightly small (14 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit The PUMA Court Rider runs true to size and fits as expected for our medium-width feet. We don't see any need for size adjustment. In the widest part of the forefoot, we measured the shoe at 100 mm - a very much average width. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Court Rider 100.0 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width The same goes for the tip of the toebox. The shoe doesn't get narrower than most basketball shoes we've tested. Our caliper shows 77.4 mm of width around the big toe. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Court Rider 77.4 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Flexibility / Stiffness Despite its overall stiff construction, the PUMA Court Rider finds some room for flexibility. Based on our force gauge measurement, it takes 34.9N to bend the shoe to a 90-degree angle. That is 68% less than it takes on average! It definitely helps the shoe stay more maneuverable on the court. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below.

Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight At first, we thought that our scales were broken...but no, they weren't. That's how heavy the PUMA Court Rider really is! At 15.8 oz (449g), it is a whole 2 ounces heavier than average! We really don't get how this PUMA shoe managed to outweigh even the Nike LeBrons . We can't really blame it on the price of the shoe either. There are a lot of budget-friendly options out there that weigh much less. Take the Jordan Luka 1 (12.8 oz) or the Nike Precision 6 (12.0 oz), for example. Test results Court Rider 15.8 oz (449g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability What may seem like breathable mesh, turns out to be misleading. We found the PUMA Court Rider to be a toasty shoe, both on the court and in our lab tests. Pumping smoke through the shoe's upper, it barely came out on the other side. The only streak of vapor appeared around the tongue. For that reason, we rated the shoe's breathability as only 2 out of 5. Your browser does not support the video tag. In the transparency test below, we put the shoe's upper against a bright light to show you that there are no ventilation pores in the fabric. Your browser does not support the video tag. We also turned to our microscope to take a closer look at the mesh. The fabric is made of multiple layers which, when combined, form a pretty tightly woven material. Test results Court Rider 2 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test We were amazed at how stable and supportive the PUMA Court Rider feels. Those extra layers of material paired with a stiff heel counter and a firm base worked wonders for lateral movements. Pretty cool that the PUMA logo works as a supportive overlay. Your browser does not support the video tag. Our feet remained locked in place and we experienced no risks of ankle rolling either. Your browser does not support the video tag. Torsional rigidity The Court Rider has a very solid build which doesn't let the shoe twist. As a result, this PUMA shoe feels like one with the foot during intensive footwork. In our manual test of torsional rigidity, we rated the shoe as 4 out of 5. This is almost as stiff as it can get in basketball shoes. Test results Court Rider 4 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness The shoe's heel counter also scores high on the stiffness test. Actually, it earned the highest score of 5/5! Rigid but well-padded, it is the perfect formula for keeping the heel securely in place. Test results Court Rider 5 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot The ensemble wouldn't be complete without a nice and wide base. We measured the widest part of the forefoot at 113.7 mm, which is about the same as the average. Test results Court Rider 113.7 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The heel, on the other hand, is insanely wide! Our caliper shows a reading of 98 mm in the widest part of the heel. This is almost a whole centimeter wider than average! This is among the widest landing areas we've seen in our lab so far. Test results Court Rider 98.0 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Outsole hardness For some reason, PUMA tends to choose soft rubber for its more affordable basketball shoes. Pressing our durometer against the outsole, we found that the rubber is only 72 HC (12% softer than average). For that reason, we do not recommend exposing the shoe to outdoor courts too often. Soft rubbers tend to wear out much faster. There are budget-friendly shoes at the same price point that have harder rubbers. Take the Nike LeBron Witness 7 for example. Test results Court Rider 72.0 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole thickness The amount of rubber used in the Court Rider's outsole is quite average. Our caliper shows 4.1 mm of thickness. Test results Court Rider 4.1 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness A thick insole is added to buffer the foot from the firmness of the sole. At 5 mm, it is a little thicker than average. Test results Court Rider 5.0 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole For those who rely on custom orthotics, the shoe's insole is easily removable. Test results Court Rider Yes Tongue padding The tongue padding is super generous in the Court Rider. Measuring it with a caliper returned a whopping 12.9 mm! That's 3.5 mm thicker than average. No wonder the shoe feels so cozy against the instep. Test results Court Rider 12.9 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type The tongue is fully gusseted in the Court Rider. It helps to keep the foot in place for intense side-to-side movements big time! Test results Court Rider Both sides (full) Heel tab The shoe doesn't make use of any pull tabs or finger loops. That's unfortunate because the gusseted tongue makes the shoe opening smaller which also makes it trickier to put the shoe on.

Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Who should buy the Nike Zoom Freak 4 The fourth of Giannis Antetokounmpo's basketball shoes fits the following well: Speedy basketball players who are lighter Players who love to do a lot of rebounds and jump shots Hoopers who play mostly or better yet exclusively indoors Wearers with narrow to medium feet Who should NOT buy this basketball shoe from Nike The Nike Zoom Freak 4 is a signature shoe from Giannis Antetokounmpo, an unusually big player. However, we believe that it is not really that good of a match for bigger players. It doesn't have a solid midfoot shank so we worry that the cushioning bottoms out quickly when worn by heavier players. The Nike LeBron 20 is a better option. These picks are nice for those with wide feet, as well. Your browser does not support the video tag. For something that is outdoor-friendly, we recommend the Nike Impact 4 . Nike Freak 4: A worthy upgrade All the modifications made to the Nike Zoom Freak 4 resulted in tremendous improvements, with our favorites being the foot containment and stability. Your browser does not support the video tag. We also appreciated the cushioning, which we thought was massively improved due to the innovative cut-outs in the heel area. Given these, the Freak 4 is indeed a worthy predecessor to the Freak 3s. Your browser does not support the video tag. Traction is great indoors While we do not consider the traction top-tier, we still concede that the Nike Zoom Freak 4 has a very solid bite, especially after we have properly broken them in. We also found the traction tremendous on organic surfaces such as those courts that are made of hardwood. Your browser does not support the video tag. Dust won't be a problem We observed that the grooves in the outsole of the shoe are wide enough not to trap dust. Hence, dust pick-up is not really a problem we faced with this basketball shoe from Nike. The Freak 4 doesn't shine outdoors but OK for occasional play We also felt that the outsole is not composed of very thick rubber, which we thought to be ideal for indoor games rather than outdoors. The rubber layer on the outsole is 4 mm thick. It's actually not the thinnest one among basketball shoes and is 0.5 mm thicker than average. This means that if you do take them on an outdoor court, it won't be as bad as some of the other shoes. Quite breathable If you choose to rock the Nike Zoom Freak 4 indoors a lot, your feet are sure to stay well-ventilated thanks to the shoe's breathable upper. Your browser does not support the video tag. Notice how the light passes not only through the toebox but through the sidewalls too. Your browser does not support the video tag. Smooth heel-to-toe transition Freak 4 made us experience really really smooth transitions from heel to toe because of the curvatures on both ends. We discovered that the shoe rocks you forward without a glitch. Your browser does not support the video tag. In addition to the curvatures, the shoe also has a good flex to it. Your browser does not support the video tag. Flexibility helps the foot bend naturally as it rolls to the toes. Your browser does not support the video tag. Impact protection is ensured Putting on the shoe, we realized it was equipped with a soft foam that offered a lot of compression. Because of this, you can rest assured that impact protection is going to be sufficient. Additionally, we found the step-in comfort is superb, especially in the heel area where the innovative cut-outs are. Based on our durometer measurements, we learned that its softness is right at the average of basketball shoes. Disclaimer: We take the measurement 5 times to make sure we got it right. Looking at the shoe's heel stack height of 32.7 mm, it is a good 5.2 mm thicker than the average. It is much more generously cushioned than most shoes. Disclaimer: We include insole thickness in the measurement as well. The insole of the Zoom Freak 4 is 4.1 mm thick. Court feel is not forgotten Even if the cushion is quite thick under the heel, it becomes thinner in the forefoot area. Hence, we acknowledge that the court feel is still really good. In the forefoot, the midsole is 8.3 mm thinner than the heel (24.4 mm). Energy return is good The midsole offers a great bounce so it is able to be incredibly fast in the midst of our games. We recognized that this is because of the independent Zoom units that are placed side-by-side in the forefoot. Your browser does not support the video tag. Cheap-feeling upper, but comfortable on-foot We were convinced that the upper materials have a very cheap feeling, so we thought they were definitely a letdown as far as the quality goes. Fortunately, the upper still feels great on foot, and it is overall pretty supportive. But we were surprised as it turned out to have good durability. Warning! The Zoom Freak 4 isn't for wide-footers Going true to size yielded us a nice snug fit that fits our foot like a glove. The shoe is slightly narrow, so wide-footers and those who want a more spacious fit can go at least half a size up. Foot containment and stability that you can depend on Although the Nike Zoom Freak 4 is not the most supportive shoe, we definitely had zero issues with this one. Your browser does not support the video tag. The heel counter has some good stiffness and padding to it, making sure our heel is also locked in place. Your browser does not support the video tag. We found that the fully-gusseted tongue on both sides makes sure that there is no side-to-side shifting of the foot either. We also can't help but notice that the Freak 4 is a lot more stable than its predecessor. This is no surprise given how wide its platform is! In the forefoot, it is 115.7 mm wide, 6.2 mm wider than the average. Nike Zoom Freak 4: Featherlight goodness At only 11 ounces or 312 grams, we absolutely felt that Freak 4 is extremely light. Your browser does not support the video tag. It is significantly lower than the 13.5 oz (383 g) average that we have on record.

Even as the older sibling of a series, this model left us in awe with its incredible style and visuals. What's more, its materials managed to balance average durability and breathability. We loved its forefoot design, as it's grippy, resistant, and bouncy, thanks to its Zoom Air unit. Its lightweight nature allowed us to run up and down the court, and its court sensibility makes it suit guards' typical playstyle, just like Tatum himself. However, the lack of rearfoot support in this Jordan was quite disappointing. Its unsteady structure made us lose confidence in our playtests.

The first model of your favourite hooper is here! Even if you're not a fan, we believe you should get this shoe if: You're looking for something lightweight with loads of court feel. You're a quick-feet player who loves fakes (ball fakes, crossover steps, or any kind). You're looking for an affordable model to play indoors. You want to look your best whilst you hoop. A bouncy forefoot is all you need. Who should not buy Affordable shoes usually have to give up some features to keep their price low. You'd normally think this model decided to use less quality materials, but that wasn't the case. Nevertheless, we found its overall structure to be quite wobbly. If you don't want to be worrying about unsteady landings, you should have a look at the Jordan Luka 2 . This model offers great support and grip, we definitely felt surefooted during our wear tests! Your browser does not support the video tag. If streetball is your thing, these Jordans are a no-no. Trust us, the white material wouldn't last a week of aggressive playing. Also, you'd need some more stability for that! If you don't mind changing brands, then you might want to try the Adidas Dame 8 . Just try to avoid dusty courts if possible! Cushioning Heel stack At 28.0 mm, these Jordans' heel stack is pretty close to the average. Normally, we would just say here what our feet felt: close contact to the court, more controlled moves, easier and more precise dribbles. But we need to mention that, as stated previously, this shoe doesn't have any rubber pods at the heel. This means that the material is less durable, which would be compensated if there was more of it, but... with a lower-than-average heel stack, it's definitely not the case. If you're looking for an affordable option but you want it to be more durable overall, including a harder rubber in the outsole, we believe you should have a look at the Under Armour Lockdown 6 . Test results Tatum 1 28.0 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack According to our durometer, at 21.9 mm the forefoot stack is just average. After our measurements, you can most likely tell that we're not talking about an extra cushioned shoe designed for centers. Just like Jayson Tatum himself, this model is made for forwards with a quick and aggressive playstyle. The court closeness that this shoe's low profile brings is what let us move around in the blink of an eye. It also made sure it was possible for our feet to follow our quick decisions, as sometimes you need to react at the speed of light when you're on the court. Your browser does not support the video tag. Following Tatum's steps (quite literally) his shoe lets you go for your best attacks, but also for your finest defense. The player himself has a very important role in his team's defensive strategy, and this could never be possible for a forward if his shoes dragged him down along the court. Test results Tatum 1 21.9 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop The forefoot and heel stacks didn't have that big of a difference. At 6.1 mm, this shoe's drop is average. You can see it clearly in the picture of our cut-in-half shoe. The heel is slightly higher, aiming for impact protection, yet the forefoot and its rubber pods are closer to the ground. Your browser does not support the video tag. We found this combination fantastic for crossover steps. It was not only the low stack that helped us control our moves. The rubber pods at the forefoot also made sure our feet stopped right where they should in our fakes. Slipping would totally ruin the jab step. Test results Tatum 1 6.1 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. At 27.3 HA, our durometer had it clear: this shoe's midsole softness is quite close to the average. We can't say this shoe is the most comfortable hooper we've tried. Its rearfoot offers some impact protection, but we don't believe focuses on that. It doesn't have any specific technologies in that area, so it's more like these Jordan's outsole and you against the court. Your browser does not support the video tag. Just by looking at this video we can clearly see the difference. This shoe's Zoom Air unit protects the forefoot, yet the rearfoot is left with nothing. The softness level and the bounce of the materials is not just easily noticed in the video, but also in our feet during our playtests. Your browser does not support the video tag. If you're looking for an affordable and comfy pal, we believe you should have a look at the Nike Precision 6 . Test results Tatum 1 27.3 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Jordan Tatum 1 fits true to size (19 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit The toebox width at the widest part was, once again, average. At 101.0 mm, our standard-width feet felt alright. We didn't have any issues, but following our caliper's measurement, we can't recommend this shoe to wide-feet hoopers. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Tatum 1 101.0 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width At 78.5 mm, the Tatum 1's toebox width at the big toe is pretty close to the average. Our toes didn't get any extra room, but our standard-width feet didn't really mind it. The shoe's structure has a protective layer on the edge, yet the blue mesh is not extremely rigid. This allowed us to bend our feet easily, which is something we appreciated when we just wanted to put these hoopers on and go play some ball straight away. This shoe follows methodology 1.7.

Test results Tatum 1 78.5 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Flexibility / Stiffness Despite what its big white TPU outside wings might tell you when you look at them, this shoe's structure is not the most supportive. It was not hard to make it bend with our hands in our torsional rigidity test, and our feet had the same experience. To know a little bit more about its flexibility, we grabbed our gauge and checked how much force was needed for this shoe to reach a 90-degree position. Your browser does not support the video tag. At 33.3N, it accompanied our moves smoothly. This meant that our heel-to-toe transitions were delightful, but that's not all. We also found this flexibility great to practice our shooting mechanics. In such exercises, it's important to be aware of the whole foot movement, especially the bending of such at the ball. Your browser does not support the video tag. This shoe follows methodology 1.7.

Even before taking it to our lab, our feet could already tell that this model is ideal to move around the court swiftly. At 11.6 oz / 329.0g, these Jordans are way lighter than average, which is a feature that we absolutely love. Your browser does not support the video tag. Running, walking, or going for a defensive balance when the opposing team gets the ball and you need to sprint across the court were never a drag for us. This shoe worked as a tool instead of an obstacle, helping us reach the attackers quickly and effectively. Don't let the NBA and its impressive plays fool you, having a good defense is just as important as being a good attacker when you play ball!

Smoke machine, we choose you! Your browser does not support the video tag. Not bad... not bad at all! As you can see in the video, there's a constant flow of smoke throughout the whole tongue. If you pay close attention, you can see a little bit of it coming out of the toebox too, which is great news! Compared to the Reebok Shaq Attaq , which scored a 1/5 in breathability, the 3/5 of these Jordans sounds like music to our ears. This is most likely because of the upper's material, so let's dive into that. Microscope, we choose you! We can clearly see two layers in the picture: a blue one and a green one. The outer one has big gaps which would definitely allow plenty of airflow; nevertheless, the inner one is tightly woven. That's why the smoke had such a hard time coming out of the shoe. Wow, wait a second! There seems to be yet at least another layer under the first green one we saw in the previous picture. This is definitely the brand's doing in order to improve durability, and we love it! Your browser does not support the video tag. We love using different tools to study every aspect of each shoe. In this case, we could see how the light happily went through the upper's woven material. Even though there are multiple layers, this explains why this model has got a better score at breathability compared to the average. We trust in the multiple-layer armour to perform nicely on our durability tests, too. Let's check it out! Test results Tatum 1 3 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Remember we were praising this shoe before because of its lightweight nature? Well, this comes at the expense of stability. Your browser does not support the video tag. You can see in the video that our ankles don't move much, which is thanks to the padded structure and leather piece this shoe has at the back. Wait, we'll show it to you with a video. Your browser does not support the video tag. So our ankles didn't really feel unsafe, but our foot itself... well, that's another story. You can see in the video how the underfoot moves even if we're just swaying our ankles. The forefoot was fine, yet the mid and rearfoot didn't feel that great to us. We could feel the lack of arch support, and the fact that this model is designed for Tatum himself, focusing on the forefoot with the snappiness of its Zoom Air Unit because of his playstyle, which means the shoe's design doesn't revolve around the heel. Your browser does not support the video tag. We caught it in this video. Can you see how the rearfoot slips when we go for a backdoor cut? It's subtle, but to us this is game-changing. Consequently, we believe you should go little by little with these hoopers. Try them out if you have the chance (even better if it's on a clean court) and see how you feel with them. Don't go for crazy jumping moves against other people (such as rebounds where you unavoidably hit other players most of the time) right off the bat. Give the shoe and your feet some time to test its stability. It was definitely not the best for us, so please be careful! Torsional rigidity A 3/5 in our torsional rigidity test is an average score in many categories. But in basketball? Nuh-uh, getting less than a 4 in this aspect might be dangerous. Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see, the shoe bends quite easily with our hands, which means it's less stable. It's got two big outer wings that surround the midfoot. This piece was what initially gave us hope, but in our torsional rigidity test and wear tests, we found out it was not supportive enough. The shoe bent with our hands and feet pretty easily, and this piece didn't stop it. Also, if you pay close attention to the sides, you can see there's a gap, which definitely didn't help regarding stability. Test results Tatum 1 3 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness A 3/5 in our heel counter stiffness test was not a result that different from what we expected. Your browser does not support the video tag. The shoe's leather material surrounding our ankles definitely added some support. We didn't have to deal with heel slippage and our ankles felt okay. Not great, but safe enough for us not to be constantly checking them. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Tatum 1 3 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot Its midsole width in the forefoot is close to the average, just slightly narrower. At 113.3 mm, our caliper confirmed what our mid-sized feet felt: a nice fit. Test results Tatum 1 113.3 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel Most likely to add some support, the brand went for a snugger fit in the ankle. At 83.1 mm, our caliper explained why we didn't have any heel slippage problems. Test results Tatum 1 83.1 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability Time to test this pair's durability: Dremel, we choose you! Let us tell you a little bit about this test. It lasts 12 seconds, and our tool goes at the speed of 10K RPM at 3.2N. We always put the rolling tip in the exact same spot. This helps us when we want to compare different shoes, as we keep the coherence in our tests. In this very specific case, we also slightly moved our Dremel away from the white layer. Your browser does not support the video tag. Why? Well, because that white overlayer that works as this shoe's protection is not all around the toebox. It's more like a tough detail! As you can see in the picture, the white layer resisted our tool's attack. But the mesh... got meshed up (so sorry about the joke). Our Dremel obliterated the blue layer, but the green underprotection held up, not letting the tool make a hole. This is what a hole looks like. Hello, Under Armour Charged Assert 10 ! Our Jordans scored a decent 3/5 in our durability test, but this poor UA pal... couldn't get any more than a 1/5. Test results Tatum 1 3 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability If you've ever played or watched basketball, no matter which level or competition, you definitely know just how much and how often players jump. And not only jumps, but dribbles, cuts, explosive moves... All this means there's constant rubbing of your foot and sock against the heel of the shoe you're wearing. To know more about this, we're going to perform our heel padding durability test. Dremel, once again, we choose you! Your browser does not support the video tag. These Jordans have us saying: \"Not bad, not bad\", after every test! Once again, an average score: 3/5. Let's have a look at the shoe's inner lining after our Dremel went all in. We can clearly see some damage, but not as much as in the UA Charged Assert 9 ... this one got completely obliterated by our tool. Now that is scary. It looks like someone just bit it! Test results Tatum 1 3 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness Breaking from its \"not bad, not bad\" status, the Tatum 1 has transformed into \"wait, really?\" after we checked its outsole hardness. We choose you, durometer! At 61.3 HC, this shoe's score is way lower than average (24% more precisely). Outsoles that get a lower score in hardness are usually less durable but have better traction. But wait, there's a very important thing that you must know before we move on. We always put our durometer in the same spot, and in the case of this shoe... it'd be measuring the midsole material. As you can see, the pink parts of the outsole are the rubber pods, the ones that will give you better traction. The rest is the material of the midsole (white) working as the outsole. This... isn't gonna have a happy ending regarding durability. Test results Tatum 1 61.3 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability As we were saying before, this model is a bit special. If we look at its outsole, we can see there are two different colours: pink and white. The pink parts are the rubber pods, which work on traction, and the white part is an extension of the midsole material. We grabbed our Dremel again, and after this test we realised how different regarding durability these two outsole pieces are. Your browser does not support the video tag. The first step of our outsole durability test was done: keep our Dremel rolling on the rubber pods! As you can see, our tool didn't quite damage the material. We were really happy about this, but there was something even better... at 0.4 mm, our gauge told us this wasn't even a scratch! It's an impressive 60% less than average, just wow! This is what it looks like after the test. Can you even spot where the dent is? Your browser does not support the video tag. We moved on to test the white part too. After all, most of this shoe's outsole is made of this white material. Even though the pink rubber pods are in the forefoot, the rearfoot doesn't have any of these protective pieces. We could already anticipate the lack of durability. Not only because it's a material that is more on the softer side (check the outsole hardness section), but also because of all the debris flying around on our video. To sum up: do not wear these Jordans outside! Streetball will ruin your them. Test results Tatum 1 0.4 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness As we were saying before, this shoe's outsole has two different parts. To measure its thickness, we grabbed our caliper and went for the pink rubber pods. At 3.1 mm, it's thinner than average. But we're not really worried about it. Why? Well, because it showed outstanding durability on our Dremel test! Test results Tatum 1 3.1 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness In order to give us a more comfortable feel, the brand used a thicker-than-average midsole. At 5.1 mm according to our caliper, this shoe's insole focused on comfort, which was very much appreciated taking into account the shoe's structure and design. Test results Tatum 1 5.1 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole We ADORE removable insoles, and these Jordans are here to tell us they are part of the club! The yellow Jumpman logo made us go absolutely crazy! But that's not the only thing we liked about this shoe's insole. It's pretty thick, but it's great news for us that it can be changed, as this model lacks arch support. So, if you need your own orthotics or some arch support, you'll have no problems with the Tatum 1. Test results Tatum 1 Yes Reflective elements No reflective elements here, but it's not like we expected them anyway! This shoe is NOT made to play streetball with you, so it's not like you'll need some extra visibility. Indoor courts tend to be better illuminated than outdoor ones! Test results Tatum 1 No Tongue padding At 8.0 mm, this Jordan's tongue padding is also not enough to overcome the general lack of foothold. Nevertheless, even though it's thinner than average, the tongue kept us protected from any kind of lace bite. Test results Tatum 1 8.0 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type The Tatum 1's tongue is fully gusseted. This added some support to the structure, especially in the instep, but it was not enough for us to feel surefooted. Even though the heel and the tongue do their best to make the structure supportive, it was definitely not enough, as the design itself doesn't focus on this aspect. Still, the lacing system did its part. It held this model's flexible profile as much as it could, and we were pretty happy with its performance. We want to mention that the eyelets in the leather part of the shoe or with a surrounding leather structure made sure we wouldn't rip them apart even if we pulled the laces strongly. Also, this structure has an extra eyelet at the top, which also helped with the overall foothold. Test results Tatum 1 Both sides (full) Heel tab As the yin for its fully gusseted tongue's yan, this shoe has got a finger-loop at the back. It didn't look or feel very durable to us, but it did its job properly. We also really like how it fits in this model's vibe and colourful structure. Hooping in style, that is!

We found it a perfectly well-rounded hoop shoe that nails every essential feature to help you perform your best on the court. But above all, this Jordan shoe inspires plenty of confidence with its stellar support and stability even during our most forceful lateral cuts. And did we mention that it weighs lighter than the average mid-cut shoe? In a word, this is a rare example of a high-priced basketball shoe that is actually worth every penny, in our opinon.

Your browser does not support the video tag. One of them is frequent outdoor court use. These conditions are likely to destroy this Jordan shoe's traction pattern too fast. Consider the Nike Cosmic Unity 3 among our other top picks for outdoor courts instead. Cushioning Heel stack As opposed to the previous editions, the 38 goes for a low-profile cushioning prioritizing court feel. This is clearly reflected in the shoe's heel stack height. Measuring it with our caliper returned a modest reading of 26.3 mm. It is a few millimeters lower than the average but is on par with the Nike LeBron 21 (26.6 mm). Your browser does not support the video tag. The shoe delivers on promise - we felt very grounded and in control of the movement during the playtest. But at the same time, we never felt as though impact protection was missing either. It is a very well-balanced setup. Test results Air  XXXVIII 26.3 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack Checking the shoe's forefoot stack, we recorded 21.0 mm of thickness which is just about the same as the average. From our experience, this stack height is very optimal for a mix of court feel and shock absorption. And it proved to be that way in this AJ shoe. Test results Air  XXXVIII 21.0 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop Contributing to the shoe's steady and grounded feel is a relatively low heel-to-toe drop. At 5.3 mm, it is a few millimeters lower than average. 5.3 mm drop of the Air Jordan XXXVIII In contrast, here is a 10-mm drop on the New Balance TWO WXY v4 (along with the higher heel stack of 31.2 mm). A shoe like this elevates the heel above the toes offering more support to the player's calves and Achilles tendons. It provides notably more impact protection too but minimizes contact with the court. 10 mm drop of the New Balance TWO WXY V4 Test results Air  XXXVIII 5.3 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. The Air Jordan XXXVIII features a brand-new cushioning setup with a full-length Cushlon 3.0 foam and a Zoom Air Strobel on top of it. As a whole, it feels moderately soft and responsive but grounded. Your browser does not support the video tag. The Cushlon 3.0 is responsible for the shoe's midsole softness showing a pretty low durometer reading of 16.0 HA. It is 60% softer than the average basketball shoe cushioning and has a very comfortable and slightly bouncy nature that doesn't lose its properties when used for extended periods of time. The foam is sandwiched between the Zoom Air Strobel, the hard rubber outsole, and the firm carrier foam which kept us well-cushioned but stable at the same time. Your browser does not support the video tag. We should also note that the XXXVIII's cushioning feels quite consistent from heels to toes because of the full-length units featured in it. The ride felt very smooth and predictable on the court which kept us very surefooted. Test results Air  XXXVIII 16.0 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Air Jordan XXXVIII fits true to size (25 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit The AJ XXXVIII made our medium-width feet feel at home in our regular US size 9. In the widest part of the toebox, our caliper showed a standard reading of 101.8 mm for a US 9 basketball shoe. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Air  XXXVIII 101.8 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width However, players with wide feet may want to go half-size up because the tapering makes the tip of the toebox narrower than average. Measuring the shoe's forefoot near the big toe, we got 73.3 mm which is a bit narrower than average. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Air  XXXVIII 73.3 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Flexibility / Stiffness We discovered that the Air Jordan XXXVIII is very rigid in the areas where it is most needed. But it doesn't lack a touch of flexibility where it makes sense. Those V-cuts in the forefoot allow the shoe to bend a bit more freely with the toes. This design was inspired by Michael Jordan's turn-around-jumper which requires a fine-tuned balance of stability and give. Your browser does not support the video tag. Using a force gauge, we recorded that the shoe requires 37.2N to reach a 90-degree bend. This is slightly less than the average (by 10%). This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Air  XXXVIII 37.2N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight Trying the Air Jordan XXXVIII for the first time, we were pleasantly surprised with its on-foot weight. Is that really a mid-cut shoe? Putting it on a scale returned 13.9 oz (396g) which is on par with the average weight of low-top kicks! With its open see-through side panes and cut-out heel collar, this version of the Air Jordan feels notably more nimble than its predecessors. Test results Air  XXXVIII 13.9 oz (394g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability We rarely come across basketball shoes with highly breathable uppers, especially mid-cut ones. But the Air Jordan XXXVIII is here to change that trend. Your browser does not support the video tag. The shoe features large and open embroidered sidewalls on both sides of the upper. Paired with large cutouts on the tongue, they keep the interiors very nicely aerated. Our feet experienced a sweet breeze during the entire playtest. Your browser does not support the video tag. Even though the shoe's toebox is covered in dense suede, we never felt as if breathability was lacking in the Air Jordan XXXVIII. Thus, we readily gave it a higher-than-average breathability score of 3. Test results Air  XXXVIII 3 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test If you're in search of the most reliable stability in a basketball shoe, you're looking at the right page. Your browser does not support the video tag. During our playtests, the AJ XXXVIII proved to be unmatched when it came to foot containment. The support came from both the reinforced sole and the sturdy mid-cut upper. Torsional rigidity The torsional rigidity of this Jordan shoe is rock-solid. Literally. Trying to twist it with our hands felt like twisting an actual rock! Your browser does not support the video tag. On a 1-5 scale where 5 is the absolute stiffest, we didn't hesitate to rate the XXXVIII with the maximum 5. The large and stiff rubber-and-plastic overlays on both sides of the platform made us feel barricaded inside the XXXVIII. Even though no shoe can guarantee 100% protection from ankle twists, we felt that it would take a lot of effort to buckle our feet in this Jordan. Your browser does not support the video tag. If you check the bottom of the shoe, you will see that those plastic overlays on the sides also wrap around the sole's forefoot section. They work together with the small black shank (visible through the V-cuts) to provide some of the highest stability levels we've experienced in a basketball shoe. The Air Jordan XXXVIII is a must for players who stay on their toes a lot throughout the game. The shoe's most effective stability is concentrated right there under the balls of their feet. Test results Air  XXXVIII 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness The shoe's substantial and well-padded collar adds yet another layer of ankle support. Your browser does not support the video tag. Just look at how little give there is to the heel counter as we push and squeeze it in our manual test. Once again, we confidently rate the Air Jordan XXXVIII with the highest stiffness score - 5 out of 5! But here is the twist - the shoe's ankle collar doesn't feel bulky or constricting at all! Why? Because its back portion has been cut out to let the dorsiflexion happen freely. We believe that this is a smart response to the never-ending discussion of what collar height is best for basketball shoes . Test results Air  XXXVIII 5 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot We already mentioned that the shoe's stability is primarily centered in the forefoot section. So it's only natural that there is a nice outrigger on the lateral side here. Our caliper showed a slightly wider-than-average measurement of 115.6 mm in the largest part of the shoe's forefoot. Test results Air  XXXVIII 115.6 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The heel portion of the XXXVIII's platform is not as wide and planted as in most basketball shoes. It feels more like a transition point that encourages the foot to hit the forefoot faster. So if your playing style involves a lot of heel-dominant strikes, you should know that this Jordan shoe has a narrower-than-average heel width of 83.4 mm (in the widest part). Test results Air  XXXVIII 83.4 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability The Jordan XXXVIII features more reinforced materials in the high-wear areas but leaves the rest of the upper open for breathability and lightness. Depending on the colorway, you are either getting synthetic leather or synthetic suede as the key toebox material. In this review, we are testing the University Red shoe's fake suede toebox. Let's see if that synthetic suede is strong enough to protect such a high-wear area as the shoe's toebox... Your browser does not support the video tag. Of course, it is! We are testing a $200 shoe after all. The suede got away with a merely cosmetic scratch which is even hard to see in the photo. Twelve seconds of drilling it with sandpaper at a 5K RPM speed did not blow through the material. It is an impressive result that earned the XXXVIII the highest toebox durability score - 5 out of 5! But that's not all. The shoe's outsole rubber extends up covering the areas prone to toe drags. This helps to prolong the shoe's potential shelf life. Test results Air  XXXVIII 5 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability The AJ XXXVIII keeps its game strong even on the inner side of the shoe. Applying the sandpaper tip of our Dremel to the fabric inside the heel counter for 4 seconds, we were satisfied with the result. Your browser does not support the video tag. The scuffing was so minor that we only subtracted one durability point from it, leaving the shoe's heel lining with a solid score of 4 out of 5. Test results Air  XXXVIII 4 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness Don't be misled by the shoe's translucent rubber - it is not the same as gum rubber. And based on our lab tests, it even beats some solid rubbers when it comes to hardness and durability! Even though rubber hardness does not guarantee higher durability, it certainly makes the shoe's outsole more hard-wearing. Looking at the 87.5 reading on our Shore C durometer, the translucent rubber of this Jordan shoe is harder than 85% of the basketball shoe outsoles we've tested. Test results Air  XXXVIII 87.5 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability The outsole continued to impress us with its excellent abrasion resistance in our Dremel test. Your browser does not support the video tag. This time, we held the tool against the shoe's rubber for 22 seconds and ramped up the speed to 10K RPM. But the material remained steadfast. It looks as though the Dremel only brushed off the dust from the treading. Checking the depth of the indentation with a tread gauge, it turned out to be the same as the average at 0.9 mm. Does this mean that the Jordan XXXVIII is good for outdoor courts? Well, occasional games should not be a problem but we are worried that with regular outdoor use, its thin herringbone lines will smooth out pretty quickly compromising the grip. The rubber itself is strong but the thin tread lines are not. Test results Air  XXXVIII 0.9 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness But if you limit the shoe to indoor courts, it will prove to be indestructible with a thick 4.0 mm rubber layer. Test results Air  XXXVIII 4.0 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness A nicely padded insole sits between the shoe's firm Zoom Air Strobel and the foot. Measuring its thickness with a caliper, we got 4.4 mm in the heel. This is a regular insole padding for a hoop shoe. Test results Air  XXXVIII 4.4 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole The stock insole is easily removable if you need a custom pair of orthotics for your basketball shoes. Test results Air  XXXVIII Yes Tongue padding About two-thirds of the shoe's tongue are very lightly padded (only a few millimeters of thickness). However, it features double padding at the topmost part where the buffer is most needed to prevent lace bites. Here, the tongue thickness exceeds the average by a few millimeters (at 11.9 mm). Test results Air  XXXVIII 11.9 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type The shoe's tongue is fully integrated into the upper creating a very secure foot containment in addition to the supportive collar. Test results Air  XXXVIII Both sides (full) Heel tab There are no finger loops or pull tabs on the shoe's collar. However, its structured nature and lowered heel portion make the on-and-off pretty effortless.

We are sure that those who want to make the best out of their purchases are going to have fun with this, as well. Aside from being a performance beast on the court, we found that this shoe also has the looks that make it suitable for casual use. When you get this, it's like getting two shoes for the price of one.

The Adidas Harden Vol. 7 also has a sock-like upper but with a much more forgiving collar. Your browser does not support the video tag. The Trae Young 2 is also not the best option for dusty and outdoor courts. We recommend Nike shoes like the Cosmic Unity 3 and the LeBron NXXT GEN for these playing conditions. The above-mentioned LeBron shoe is also 1.5 oz (43g) lighter than the Adidas Trae Young 2. Cushioning Heel stack If we had to name just one reason to get this Adidas Trae Young shoe, it would definitely be its impact protection. The slab of Boost foam at the heel is quite generous leading to a stack height of 32.1 mm. On paper, that's only about 2 mm above average but on the court, it feels immensely pampering and protective. Test results Trae Young 2 32.1 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack As for the forefoot, the Lightsrike foam layer comes in at 21.5 mm, based on our caliper measurement. This is right about the same as the average. Nothing to write home about. Test results Trae Young 2 21.5 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop The difference in stack heights gives us a 10.6 mm drop. Being slightly taller than average, it clearly shows how this Trae Young shoe is more biased towards heel cushioning. Explosive players who land a lot on their heels are sure to appreciate this setup. Test results Trae Young 2 10.6 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. During our playtests, we couldn't help but notice how plush and shock-absorbing the Boost cushioning was! Your browser does not support the video tag. Using our trusty durometer to check the foam's softness, we got a mind-blowing reading of 11.5 HA! In normal people speak, this means 131% softer than average! Unbelievable! Test results Trae Young 2 11.5 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Secondary foam softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. As you can probably tell from the video above, the shoe's forefoot cushioning is not as plush and compressive. The Lightstrike used here is notably firmer, with a durometer measurement of 22.5 HA. That is the same balance of softness and firmness as we see in most hoop shoes. Having a firmer type of foam in the midfoot and forefoot certainly helps the shoe feel more stable. It also adds a bit of bounce for jumps. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Trae Young 2 22.5 HA Average 27.8 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Size and fit Size Adidas Trae Young 2 fits slightly small (19 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit Do take these measurements with a grain of salt given the shoe's knit upper. If we were to trust our caliper reading only (92.6 mm in the widest part of the forefoot), this Adidas shoe would be 8.5 mm narrower than average! And yet, on foot, it is actually quite accommodating. So much so that it can even fit a wider foot! We also noticed that after a few times, the material breaks in and stretches even more. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Trae Young 2 92.6 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width We also checked the toebox width around the big toe and the caliper returned 71.2 mm. Again, narrower than average but not an issue when actually worn on foot. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Trae Young 2 71.2 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Lacing The laces don't really do anything in this Adidas shoe because, well, it fits snug even without them. Just be careful not to cinch the shoestrings down too tight because that will only add pressure to the already close-fitting experience. Flexibility / Stiffness We really enjoyed the smooth and seamless heel-to-toe transitions of this Adidas shoe. They seem to be created by multiple factors: midsole curvature in the heel raised toe tip really good amount of forefoot flex Your browser does not support the video tag. To measure the latter, we used a gauge that shows how much force it takes to bend this Adidas shoe to a 90-degree angle. Turns out, much less than average! It required only 31.4N which is 30% less than it takes a typical basketball shoe. Apparently, freedom of movement is a must for Trae Young's feet! This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Trae Young 2 31.4N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight Given that it was designed in collaboration with Trae Young, we did expect a lightweight and speedy shoe. Unfortunately, this was not the case. According to our scale measurement, this Adidas shoe comes in at 14.8 oz (420g) in a men's US size 9. That's half an ounce heavier than the average basketball shoe in our lab. On a lighter note, the Trae Young 2 is not as heavy as the Adidas Harden Vol. 7 (16.5 oz). Test results Trae Young 2 14.8 oz (420g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability What can we say, the shoe's Primeknit upper looks like a sweater and certainly feels like one! So the fact that it had decent breathability was a nice surprise to us. Putting this Adidas shoe to our demonstrative smoke test, we found that it is pretty stuffy in the toebox but still lets the air pass through the instep area. Your browser does not support the video tag. Adidas Trae Young 2 vs. Under Armour Curry 10 (the most ventilated hoop shoe out there!) This convinced us to give the shoe's breathability a balanced score of 3 out of 5. It is not ideal for a hot summer session but has more airflow than basketball shoes on average. To support our findings in the smoke-pumping machine test, we also put the shoe's upper against bright light. This test clearly shows that the material is extra tightly woven in the toebox but is a little bit more transparent in the tongue. Your browser does not support the video tag. And if you are wondering how \"tightly woven\" we are talking, our microscope shots help to demonstrate that very well. There are no defined ventilation holes in sight! Test results Trae Young 2 3 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Despite all that plush cushioning in the heel, the Adidas Trae Young 2 felt impressively stable in our playtests! We must say that the shoe kept our feet securely in place at all times, even during the most intense movements. Torsional rigidity One major contributor to the shoe's supportive construction is of course the presence of a torsion plate in the midsole. But in this Adidas shoe, it's more than just a linear shank. It is a strategically designed, firm, and sturdy TPU unit that extends outwards and to the sides of the platform, holding it firmly and not letting it twist. When we actually tried twisting the shoe in our hands, there was little-to-no give. Thus, we rated its torsional stiffness with the highest possible score - 5 out of 5. This rigidity really enhances the shoe's stability and helps to prevent a nasty ankle twist. Test results Trae Young 2 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness Seeing a knit upper always makes us a little suspicious of the shoe's foothold. However, Adidas came up with a pretty effective workaround here. Ankle pillows! Your browser does not support the video tag. Having two generously padded units on both sides of the ankle proved to be very helpful in keeping it securely in place. They actually added some structural integrity to the rearfoot, convincing us to give a high score of 4 out of 5 for the shoe's heel counter stiffness. We experienced zero heel slips. Test results Trae Young 2 4 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot What else makes the Adidas Trae Young 2 feel so stable? Its monstrously wide platform! No seriously, this is by far the widest base we've seen in a basketball shoe! Measuring the widest part of the forefoot with a caliper, we got a whopping 122.2 mm! That's almost a centimeter wider than average! Test results Trae Young 2 122.2 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel But wait, it gets crazier in the heel. In the widest part, our caliper showed 101.6 mm which is also a good centimeter wider than average. We can definitely see how Trae Young would want this kind of landing area for his lightning-quick direction changes. Test results Trae Young 2 101.6 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability But, fortunately, the lack of breathability is very well compensated for by the knit's wear resistance. Drilling the shoe's toebox for a good 12 seconds at a 5K RPM speed, the material barely got any damage! And we didn't even drill it where the suede overlay is! Your browser does not support the video tag. Getting a perfect score of 5 out of 5 for its toebox durability, the Trea Young 2 really stands out from the average basketball shoe. And it's not even made of synthetic leather! In the comparison photo below, you can see how bad it can get when we put mesh uppers through the same Dremel test. Adidas Trae Young 2 vs. Adidas Harden Stepback 3 Test results Trae Young 2 5 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability We also checked the durability of another sensitive upper area - the shoe's heel lining and padding. Your browser does not support the video tag. That's where the Adidas Trae Young 2 did a pretty average job. Assessing the damage caused by 4 seconds of drilling, we rated its wear resistance as 3 out of 5. That's quite normal for a typical hoop shoe. Although there is a caveat - with the amount of effort it takes to get this thing on our feet, we might as well tear the collar up in a few months! We'll talk more on that in the Size and it section. Test results Trae Young 2 3 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness Feeling how hard the shoe's outsole rubber was gave us a lot of confidence in its durability. Initially. Our experience was indeed proved by the durometer reading of 84.8 HC which is harder than average! But apparently, this wasn't enough to make the Adidas Trae Young 2 a solid outdoor-ready option. Test results Trae Young 2 84.8 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability When it was time to get real with this Adidas shoe, we turned to our Dremel and found that its outsole performed worse than average. Your browser does not support the video tag. After 22 seconds of drilling at a high speed of 10K RPM, the outsole developed a 1.6 mm deep dent. That's more than what we normally get in hoop shoes that are meant for hardcore outdoor use. For example, the Harden Vol. 7 only got 0.5 mm. But the good news is that the Trae Youg 2 is not horrible for outdoor courts either! We think that you can absolutely enjoy an occasional game without worrying about destroying the shoe. Test results Trae Young 2 1.6 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness The amount of rubber protecting this Adidas shoe is also slightly thinner compared to other shoes. Our caliper shows 3.4 mm which is a little below the average. Test results Trae Young 2 3.4 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness We always include the insole when measuring stack heights. In the case of the Adidas Trae Young 2, it is 3.9 mm thick in the heel. Slightly thinner than average, but still feels amazing underfoot combined with the Boost/Lightstrike setup.

Test results Trae Young 2 Yes Tongue padding Lace bites could very likely be a problem for high-arched players as there is only 1.3 mm of material separating the skin from the laces. Test results Trae Young 2 1.3 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type Given the shoe's sock-like collar, it doesn't have a tongue per se. The upper is made of this one-piece sockliner that is sewn together at the bottom of the shoe, underneath the insole. That way, it feels very much like a sock! Once on, the shoe feels amazingly comfortable against the foot. And we could write a poem about its coziness if it wasn't for one \"little\" problem... It is a real pain in the neck to put on! Because of its quite narrow and not-so-stretchy opening, we really struggled to get the Adidas Trae Young 2 on. Every. Single. Time! And it doesn't get better with time, unfortunately. Test results Trae Young 2 Sock like Heel tab It was very kind of Adidas to add two pull tabs on both sides of the collar but... it would be nice if they actually helped to get the shoe on more easily.

We've found it's incredibly durable, stable, comfortable, and ready for your hoops outdoors. It lets you feel every bit of the court so you can perform at an NBA point guard level, and it does it with style! Even though heel slippage might be an issue, we've confirmed a runners knot or double socks easily get rid of the problem. If you want a shoe that boosts your attacks as well as your confidence, we definitely recommend this supportive pal!

A player who wants a stable and grippy pair for fast moves. In need of some extra ankle support. A streetball lover who is looking for a very durable pal. A stylish hooper who's on a budget. A \"feeling the court under your feet is the best\" type of player. Who should not buy If you want something that goes out with you to play some ball in the summer, this ain't it! In our lab and wear tests, we discovered this shoe is hella warm, and our sweaty feet were a thing. If you want something well-ventilated that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, we think you should go for the Nike LeBron Witness 7 . Your browser does not support the video tag. If you want something plush, we recommend you keep exploring LeBron's collection , as its models are focused on impact protection. After all, LeBron is not only a big player when we talk about skills! Then, if you want something that accommodates wide feet and you are a big Dame fan, try the Adidas Dame 8 . This shoe is slightly more expensive, but you can keep it stylish with its multiple colorways and it's also okay for outdoor courts! Cushioning Heel stack At 30.3 mm, our caliper just shows us that the heel stack of this shoe is average. Point guards' shoes are usually designed for you to feel the court, so adding some extra cushioning would be a mistake! This also helps keeping its weight low. Your browser does not support the video tag. You can clearly see in the video that it's not the plushest shoe out there. Still, it managed to give us a wonderful balance between court feel and impact protection. If you need or prefer something that feels more like a cloud... in the Nike Lebrons we trust! Test results Dame Certified 30.3 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack The forefoot stack is also lower than average, which means your toes will be closer to the court. At 20.5 mm, our caliper explained to us with just a couple of numbers why we felt so stable and in control of our every move. We're loving how point guard shoes such as the Trae Young 3 are keeping it low. Actually, regarding the sole, both pairs felt quite similar when we tried them in our wearability test. It was a very balanced and controlled experience that let us move around freely, with and without the ball. Your browser does not support the video tag. Look at that. Even if we had to recalculate our moves a bit, this shoe provided us with all the stability we needed. Test results Dame Certified 20.5 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop As its forefoot stack is quite low, this shoe's drop is higher than average. We can clearly see the height difference between the front and the back of the shoe in the picture. At 9.8 mm, this should not be something that your feet need to get used to. Low and high drops are neither good nor bad, it just depends on your personal preferences or playstyle! Test results Dame Certified 9.8 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. Following the results of the previous tests, we already anticipated this shoe was not gonna be plush. At 30.0 HA, our durometer confirmed it. During our wearability test games, we did feel this pair wasn't the softest out there. It wasn't uncomfortable, though, don't get us wrong! Just not a cloud. If you're looking for a pair that guarantees plushness and extra-soft landings, and you still want to play outdoors, then go for the Nike KD 15 . Test results Dame Certified 30.0 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Adidas Dame Certified fits true to size (21 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit The toebox width at the widest part is just average, so nothing different to point out over here! This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Dame Certified 102.4 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width Regarding the toebox width at the big toe, there is something we'd like to point out. At 79.5 mm, it's slightly wider than average, which is something we adore. Why? Because it's accommodating for wide-toe players! The ones among us who had slightly bigger toes were completely in love with this design choice. Still, don't forget we do NOT recommend this pair to wide-footed players! This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Dame Certified 79.5 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Flexibility / Stiffness With the high scores this Adidas got in the rigidity tests, we didn't expect it to be flexible. Nevertheless, we did feel that it moved alongside our feet when we were playing, so... we had to take it to our lab to find out what was up! Your browser does not support the video tag. Using a gauge to check the force needed to bend this pair to a 90-degree angle, we couldn't help but dramatically gasp when we checked the results. At 35.5N, it's more flexible than average... WHAT?! Your browser does not support the video tag. Our feet were right and our logic was wrong? It does seem so! Our heel-to-toe transitions were smooth and unintrusive. We enjoyed this not only walking around court, but also warming up! You know, when you are still getting there, right before the game. One of our favourite parts about this shoe is definitely the mix between the safety of its rigid structure and the unrestricted ride of its bendy design. What a great combo, Adidas! This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Dame Certified 35.5N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight As this shoe is a tough one, we thought it would be heavy. But when we tried it on for the first time... we didn't get that feeling. At 14.3 oz / 404.0g, this pair's weight is just average. We can't say it's lightweight, but it didn't feel like we were carrying stones in our feet when we were playing either. It lets you jump and move around without any problems! It also features a lightweight Bounce midsole for better cushioning, which we definitely felt when we went for the rebound! Damian Lillard is a point guard and, even though it depends on their playstyle, these types of players usually like light shoes that let them move fast across the court. If you're a Dame lover but you're looking for something lighter, we've got it: the Adidas Dame 8 might just be what you need! Test results Dame Certified 14.3 oz (404g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability Not every basketball shoe has the same features just because it's used to play ball. Depending on your preferences, needs, taste, or even playstyle, there are models with different advantages that will make you enjoy this sport to the fullest. Here, in RunRepeat, we make each and every one of them go through the same procedures and tests. In this way, we can give you the most accurate comparison and you can buy the exact shoe you're looking for. The Adidas Dame Certified's first trial is the breathability test. What we do is we put smoke inside the shoe and see how much its upper materials let go. Check the video below! Your browser does not support the video tag. It looks like you haven't pressed play, but... it is working. So, yeah, that's the amount of smoke this shoe releases. Earning a 1 out of 5, it has absolutely lost this 1vs1 facing the Under Armour Curry Flow 10 , which earned a solid 5/5 in this same test. We were not satisfied with this, as the hot game hot shoe partnership is not of our liking. So we decided to perform our light test to check if the shoe had any ventilation holes or gaps that would let that light shine through. Your browser does not support the video tag. The result? TOTAL AIR BALL. What a miss! Not even the tongue, that can be seen letting some smoke out in the breathability test, has any kind of opening to let the shoe breathe! And... our microscope just confirmed it. The first layer does have some gaps, but we can see a second layer underneath that's definitely not letting any air come in and out. We actually thought there would be some improvement in this area in comparison to the Adidas Dame 8 , which scored a 2 out of 5 on this same test. But the results were even worse! If you're looking for a breathable shoe that won't make you spend all your savings, we recommend the Nike LeBron Witness 7 . Test results Dame Certified 1 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Due to our in-game experience, we already knew this pair would be stable. It kept protecting our ankles from painful twisting and spraining, so when we performed our lateral stability test, we knew we were gonna be happy with the results. Your browser does not support the video tag. And we were! In our opinion, this is a key feature for basketball shoes. In such an intense and aggressive sport, physically talking, we need to be as protected as possible! That's why this pair's solid structure was there for us... and we loved it! Your browser does not support the video tag. Look at our ankles not wobbling even a little bit after a move as powerful as a backdoor cut! Torsional rigidity Remember we've just mentioned this shoe having a solid structure? Well, it's not just solid, it's the most solid. To support the fast, quick, and unexpected moves of point guards (and every player with a playstyle based on speed), we need a pair with a strong design that doesn't put your joints at risk. Scoring a 5 out of 5 in our torsional rigidity test, the Dame Certified are your new reliable pals to keep moving. Your browser does not support the video tag. You can see it in the video, the shoe barely moves! This made us feel safe, and we were not scared of going ahead and trying some powerful and assertive moves such as jab steps or ball fakes. Test results Dame Certified 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness We've got bad news and good news here. Good news first? Your browser does not support the video tag. Scoring a 4 out of 5 in our heel counter stiffness test, our feet felt safe and protected. Getting such a high score sometimes comes with a price, right? Such as blisters or heel rubbing, but in this case... not at all! After all, it did score a 5/5 in our heel padding durability test, so don't worry, this Adidas is a certified plushy friend! And look at how cool the 3 stripes look there, we really liked this design choice! And for our bad news... Ugh, heel slippage. We KNOW!!! This doesn't make much sense, like... isn't it a shoe with a solid, snug, and stiff structure? It is! And it still has the issue of heel slippage? It does! And it sucks. But hey, don't worry, we've got some solutions for you! In our experience, tying the laces in a runners knot (check our lacing technique guide right here ) or wearing double socks worked wonders. No more heel slippage! Test results Dame Certified 4 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot Great news regarding its midsole! At 120.1 mm, this shoe's forefoot is pretty wide. And we LOVE it. Test results Dame Certified 120.1 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel Our caliper just confirmed that this is indeed a stable shoe, and all thanks to its wide midsole! At 95.6 mm, our standard-sized feet felt comfy and supported. Nevertheless, the wide-footed testers among us were not that happy with the Dame Certified's fit. They claimed the shoe was too tight in the midfoot, making the whole thing uncomfortable. As its structure is very rigid, you shouldn't expect it to be forgiving or accommodating. If you want a wide-foot friendly pair that you can wear on outdoor courts, try the Adidas Dame 8 . Test results Dame Certified 95.6 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability Trading breathability for durability, the Dame Certified are a very resistant pair! Your browser does not support the video tag. We test all our shoes in the same spot so our results are coherent, objective, and constant. Luckily, in this case we could actually try both parts of the toebox: its protective white layer and the green mesh. And wow, just look at that! It did look more dramatic in the video, but in the final picture? Not at all! This shoe is made to be an amour for your feet. Earning a well-deserved 4 out of 5, this Adidas is ready to protect you. Sometimes it's easier to actually believe the damage our Dremel causes is not that bad when we compare it with another shoe. On the left side, with a 4/5 in our toebox durability test and an extra rubber layer to protect our feet... the Adidas Dame Certified! On the right side, with a 1/5 in our toebox durability test and a hole bigger than the rim itself... the Nike Precision 6 ! Listen, if this was a boxing match, the Adidas shoe would EVAPORATE the Nike one! Test results Dame Certified 4 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability The heel follows the same logic! You know, sometimes it's said that the best defense is a good offense, but... the Dame Certified believes the best offense is a good defense. And so do we! Your browser does not support the video tag. Our Dremel literally had NO chance against it. Scoring a solid 5/5 in heel padding durability, believe us when we say this test was merely a tickle attack for this Adidas shoe. Can you even see the damage, though? It's pretty much invisible! This means that this shoe will definitely last a long time. If we compare the damage with the one the Reebok Answer DMX (on the right) suffered in this same test... you'll definitely understand why we called this a tickle attack for the Dame Certified. No kidding, this shoe is a certified fighter! Test results Dame Certified 5 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness We grabbed our durometer to see if the outsole of this pair is a toughie like its upper. At 83.0 HC, it's pretty close to the average. As this pair is used to hoop outdoors, it needs to be hard and durable to be cut to play streetball with you, right? Test results Dame Certified 83.0 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability Its outsole MUST be designed to withstand concrete and pavement's abrasion. Like, it's a bball outdoor shoe, it's bound to be a fighter! Your browser does not support the video tag. After our 22-second test at a speed of 10KRPM, our Dremel left a 0.8 mm deep dent. You can barely see it. And with the high-ish and wavy pattern of the outsole, there is still a considerable amount of rubber to destroy before you actually make it to the shoe's bottom. All in all, we're very happy to say this is a durable pal for your games. Bring it on! Test results Dame Certified 0.8 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness We were a little bit surprised with the results when we grabbed our caliper. You need a thick and hard outsole to be able to play outside without any concerns. At 2.9 mm, this shoe's outsole is way thinner than average. It's true that its rubber is hard, but not that much! This raised some concerns, but it was all gone when we tried this pair out in our wear tests and it performed incredibly well. We took the pictures indoors because the light, view, and surroundings were nicer, but we also tested this shoe outdoors. Turns out its sole is not the thickest and hardest one around, but this translates into ground feel. When we wore this Adidas, we were in control of our moves and we actually performed the hardest ones better, such as spin, behind the back, and change of pace dribbles. Nevertheless, if you're looking for a shoe with one of the firmest, hardest, and most durable outsole that we have ever tested, you should have a look at the Reebok Answer DMX . But let us warn you: its heel padding is not as tough! Test results Dame Certified 2.9 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness As we expected, this shoe's insole is around average, just slightly thinner. At 4.2 mm, this design choice was the right one to keep the Adidas Dame Certified's weight low. It also helps feeling everything you step on, so we loved it! Test results Dame Certified 4.2 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole You can use your own orthotics with this shoe. It has a removable insole! Test results Dame Certified Yes Reflective elements No reflective elements here! We don't think those are necessary when you play indoors, but... in our opinion, they are very convenient for outdoor courts! Just think about it: shorter days during winter, less daylight... So, we've got an idea. Hey, Adidas, what about making the 3 stripes at the rearfoot reflective? Wouldn't that be incredibly awesome? You know what, you don't need to answer, we already know it's a million-dollar idea! Test results Dame Certified No Tongue padding Even though it's not a heavy shoe, its tongue is thickly padded. At 11.0, this might add some extra weight to the shoe, but we found it quite convenient to face the heel slippage issue. Why? Because even when we strongly pulled the laces to make the Dane Certified fit snugger, we didn't experience any kind of lace bite! Test results Dame Certified 11.0 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type A both-sides-full gusseted tongue a day, keeps the... injuries away! This contributes to the overall stability and lock-in feel that your feet need to play with no regrets! Test results Dame Certified Both sides (full) Heel tab In basketball, we have what's called a four-point play. It's pretty rare, but it happens! To keep it short, it's basically when you achieve a 3-point shot and you're fouled in the act of shooting. This means that you get 3 points + 1 if you actually make the following free throw. The Adidas Dame Certified follows that same logic when it comes to finger loops, look! A finger loop at the top of the tongue, and two extra details to keep the laces (and the style) on point.

While it does not excel in any performance aspects aside from durability during our tests, it leaves no room for complaints. It works for us, and it's all that matters.

If you want a shoe with better ventilation at the same price point, you can go for the Jordan Zion 2 or the Nike Zoom Freak 4 . If you have more dollars to spare, going for the Curry Flow 10 from Under Armour is the perfect move! Your browser does not support the video tag. Though we don't consider the cushioning of this shoe a problem, some players might prefer their shoes to feel softer underfoot. They might be better off with shoes like the Harden Vol. 7 or the Trae Young 2 , which are both from Adidas . The Harden Vol. 7, being a shoe for a big guy like James Harden, is also a wide-feet friendly pick. Cushioning Heel stack The thickness of the heel felt like the usual. True enough, our caliper measured it to be just around the average at 31.2 mm. Test results TWO WXY V4 31.2 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack Just like the heel, the forefoot did not feel extraordinary. True enough, our caliper measured its thickness to be 21.3, a figure that does not deviate significantly from the average. Test results TWO WXY V4 21.3 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop Given that both the heel and the forefoot were of average thickness, we expected the drop to be just around the average, too. We were proven right when our calculations revealed that the upper is 9.9 mm. Your browser does not support the video tag. Now did we have problems with the average thickness of the midsole? Not at all! Quite on the contrary, we appreciated that this kind of cushioning setup gave us the right balance between compression and court feel. We gained control over our steps and got protected from impact all at the same time. Test results TWO WXY V4 9.9 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. Though it felt nowhere near the softness delivered by the Adidas Harden Vol. 7 , we still did not have problems with the softness of the New Balance TWO WXY V4's midsole. Your browser does not support the video tag. It was enough to keep us protected and pain-free as we ran up and down the court and attempted to score with multiple jump shots. Our HA durometer gave it a rating of 25.0. Test results TWO WXY V4 25.0 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size New Balance TWO WXY V4 fits true to size (17 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit Using a caliper, we learned that the New Balance TWO WXY V4 measures 101.7 mm at the widest part of its toebox. This number is almost equal to the measurement of the typical basketball shoe. Given this, we can safely say that this basketball shoe is not for those with unusually wide or narrow feet. Both types of players must be willing to make size adjustments so that they can enjoy the full potential of this NB hoop shoe. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results TWO WXY V4 101.7 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width At the big toe, the measurement of the New Balance TWO WXY V4 did not deviate from the average. Our caliper measured this part of the shoe to be 75.9 mm wide. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results TWO WXY V4 75.9 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Flexibility / Stiffness The New Balance TWO WXY V4 felt like it had the usual flexibility. We measured how much force was needed for it to bend at 90 degrees, and we saw that it needed 44.4N, which is just slightly greater than the force needed by the typical basketball shoe. The reduced flexibility definitely helped with this shoe's stability and lockdown. If this shoe were a cage, we were sure that our feet were not going anywhere once they were placed inside the New Balance TWO WXY V4! This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results TWO WXY V4 44.4N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight Given its durability, we expected the New Balance TWO WXY V4 to be on the heavier side. We were pleasantly surprised when we saw that it was even slightly lighter than average at 13.1 ounces or 370 grams. For sure, this shoe was never a chore to wear. Test results TWO WXY V4 13.1 oz (370g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability There are visible perforations in the upper of the New Balance TWO WXY V4; however, they did not translate to breathability that we could appreciate. We felt the heat, and our feet started to feel uncomfortable as our games dragged on. Your browser does not support the video tag. This shoe is visibly not of the same level as the Under Armour Curry 10 , which scored a 5 out of 5 on our smoke test. We could only give it a 2 out of 5 simply because the smoke that we pumped into the shoe found it hard to escape through the upper material. If not for the spaces on the sides of the tongue, there would have been no escape! Yikes! Your browser does not support the video tag. The results of our light test were also not that notable. The holes and vents did not let a lot of light pass. We examined the upper material under our in-lab microscope, and we saw that there was still another layer of material underneath the visible holes. Because of this obstruction, both smoke and light were not able to easily pass through. Are the holes just there for aesthetics? It surely felt like it! Test results TWO WXY V4 2 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test We had issues with the lateral hold that this shoe had on our feet. The medial side seemed to lack some stiffness, and our feet tended to sway a bit too far in that direction. Fortunately, this did not result in slips but it sure did lead to some wobbliness especially when we executed quick sidesteps. Torsional rigidity The mild flimsiness of the medial sidewalls was well compensated by the stiffness of the base. Aside from contributing a great deal to the stability of our steps, the stiff base also successfully prevented painful slips. Your browser does not support the video tag. We manually assessed the torsional rigidity of the New Balance TWO WXY V4 in our lab, and we were just so happy to give it a well-deserved 5 out of 5. Test results TWO WXY V4 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness Our manual lab assessments revealed that the heel had moderate stiffness. This was a good thing because it gave a secure clasp around the rearfoot without being too restrictive. We still had enough flexibility to position our feet appropriately when we had to catch the ball at unique angles. And we  still had enough stiffness to prevent ankle twisting. Test results TWO WXY V4 3 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot The width of the forefoot part of the platform is greater than usual at 119.5 mm. The above-average width of this part contributed to this shoe's stability. Test results TWO WXY V4 119.5 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The heel part of the platform was just around the average at 91.6 mm wide. Test results TWO WXY V4 91.6 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability During our test games, our shoes got stepped on several times. We also even dragged the toebox against the floor when we were dribbling, trying to get past our defender. Fortunately, the toebox successfully weathered all that pressure. Your browser does not support the video tag. In the lab, even the Dremel was not able to cause significant damage. It fared better than the budget-friendly Nike Precision 6 ,  which did not even put up any form of resistance AT ALL (hence its score of 1 out of 5). The TWO WXY V4 truly deserved the 4 out of 5 for durability that the shoe got from us. Test results TWO WXY V4 4 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability The heel padding was even more impressive. It did not only feel comfortable and secure, it felt incredibly durable as well. We could say goodbye to blisters without feeling too flimsy in the process. Your browser does not support the video tag. Our Dremel test only confirmed our initial observations. Our high-pressure Dremel drilling did not even leave any visible mark on the heel padding. If we could give more than a perfect 5, we definitely would! Test results TWO WXY V4 5 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness The outsole of the New Balance TWO WXY V4 did not feel too soft or too firm. Our HC durometer gave it a rating of 83.5 and it felt just right. It was firm enough to resist abrasion and it was malleable enough to enhance its bite on the floor. Test results TWO WXY V4 83.5 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability Durability-wise, the outsole of this New Balance basketball shoe was truly a bomb. None of the rubbing and quick changes in direction that we did on both indoor and outdoor courts eroded the outsole. Your browser does not support the video tag. We subjected the outsole to our Dremel test, and we are pleased to see that it incurred a dent that was only 0.7 mm deep. This is a lot shallower than the dent we'd seen on the average basketball shoe outsole. Test results TWO WXY V4 0.7 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness Aside from being durable, the outsole was also thicker than average at 5.1 mm. Because of these observations, we are confident to recommend this shoe for outdoor use. Its performance is even comparable to the Nike Cosmic Unity 3 , which currently is among the best for outdoor use in our inventory. Test results TWO WXY V4 5.1 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness The insole was removable, and it was just as thick as the average at 4.9 mm. Test results TWO WXY V4 4.9 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole Because the insole was removable, it was easy for us to make space for orthotics and outer inserts that helped us perform better. Test results TWO WXY V4 Yes Tongue padding The tongue has the usual amount of padding. Through our caliper measurements, we learned that the tongue is 9.9 mm thick. Not only did the tongue help with fit, but it also enhanced our experience of in-shoe comfort. Test results TWO WXY V4 9.9 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type The TWO WXY V4 has fully gusseted construction. This design helped in ensuring a more secure foot containment. We appreciated it so much when our games became a bit more intense and our movements became more aggressive than usual. Test results TWO WXY V4 Both sides (full) Heel tab The TWO WXY V4 does not have a heel tab. We also do not think it's necessary because the shoe itself was so easy to put on and take off.

For that purpose, we recommend the Jordan Zion 2 instead. Your browser does not support the video tag. And if you are in dire need of dust-resistant outsoles, it is far better for them to get the Adidas D.O.N Issue #4 or the Nike Zoom Freak 4 . Cushioning Heel stack Measuring its stack height with a caliper, we found that the Rise Nitro is 29.5 mm thick in the heel. It's about the same as the average. Impact protection is definitely NOT lacking in this PUMA basketball shoe. Test results Rise Nitro 29.5 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack There is also an ample amount of cushioning added under the toes. We measured the shoe's forefoot stack height at 21.4 mm which is the same as the average of our lab-tested hoop shoes. Test results Rise Nitro 21.4 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop The difference in stack heights gave us a heel-to-toe drop of 8.1 mm, which is about a millimeter taller than average. Based on our experience with the shoe, the full-length Nitro foam has a highly efficient shock absorption with a nice touch of court feel. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Rise Nitro 8.1 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. The Rise Nitro offers a pretty comfortable underfoot experience with its Nitro foam. Pressing a durometer against it, we got a reading of 23.1 HA, which is around 20% softer than most shoes. However, this PUMA shoe is not necessarily a plush one as the foam is locked inside a rubber carrier which dampens the softness a bit. Your browser does not support the video tag. For that reason, the shoe may feel underwhelming. It lacks the fun and bounce you might expect from a shoe of with this much cushioning. But on the bright side, the Rise Nitro made us feel nice and grounded. Test results Rise Nitro 23.1 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Secondary foam softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. Under the heel, we found an additional cushioning unit. PUMA doesn't specify what type of foam that is but it is a bit firmer than the primary Nitro foam. Measuring its softness with a durometer, we found that this component is firmer than the Nitro by 15%. We assume that its purpose is to make heel landings more stable and protected. Test results Rise Nitro 26.5 HA Average 27.8 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Size and fit Size PUMA Rise Nitro fits true to size (16 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit This basketball shoe from PUMA treated us to a very accurate true-to-size fit which required no size adjustments. Checking the toebox width in its widest part, our caliper showed 102.1 mm. It's even a couple of millimeters wider than average. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Rise Nitro 102.1 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width The shoe doesn't lose its roominess towards the toes either. We measured the toebox width around the big toe and found that at 79.4 mm, it is also a couple of millimeters wider than most shoes. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Rise Nitro 79.4 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Flexibility / Stiffness With all that stability packed into the PUMA Rise Nitro, the shoe still remains fairly flexible. Using a force gauge, we measured that it takes 36.6N to bend the shoe to a 90-degree angle. That's 14% less than it takes a basketball shoe on average. It helps to make the shoe's ride smooth and easy. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Rise Nitro 36.6N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight Despite its seemingly minimal design, the PUMA Rise Nitro turned out to be heavier than average. We weighed the shoe at 15.0 oz (426g) in a men's US size 9. This is more than an ounce heavier than our lab-tested basketball shoes on average. It is about the same weight as the Nike Lebron 20 ! Test results Rise Nitro 15.0 oz (426g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability The PUMA Rise Nitro is one of those few basketball shoes with an actually breathable upper. Based on a smoke-pumping test illustrated in the video below, we evaluated the shoe's ventilation capacity as 4 out of 5. This is one of the most aerated shoes in our basketball catalog. Your browser does not support the video tag. Perforations in the upper become even more apparent when putting the shoe against a bright light. Your browser does not support the video tag. Here is a close-up view of the shoe's breathability cells taken through our microscope. Test results Rise Nitro 4 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test Stability and lateral containment are exceptionally good in the PUMA Rise Nitro. The support is coming from the shoe's sturdy base that's enhanced with a shank, the stiff and padded heel counter, and the strategically placed PWRTAPE on the upper. The latter kind of reminded us of athletic taping used on people. Torsional rigidity Thanks to the stiff asymmetrical shank embedded into the midsole, there is little-to-no twisting of the PUMA Rise Nitro. On a 1-5 scale where 5 is the stiffest, we rated the shoe as 4. Your browser does not support the video tag. This is a major stability factor during all those fast and shifty movements. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Rise Nitro 4 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness In our manual check of the heel counter, we rated its stiffness as 3 out of 5. It also provided a solid lockdown to keep our heels and ankles steady during the playtest. Your browser does not support the video tag. Once the shoe was laced up, our feet weren't going anywhere. Test results Rise Nitro 3 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot To further elevate its stability game, the PUMA Rise Nitro went for an extra-wide platform. Our caliper shows a notably wider-than-average base in both the heel and the forefoot. The widest part of the forefoot comes in at 119.8 mm which is about 7 mm wider than average! Test results Rise Nitro 119.8 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel The same occurs in the heel. In the widest part of the sole, our caliper shows 95.2 mm. This is a good 5 mm wider than average. Test results Rise Nitro 95.2 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability Seeing how soft the knit fabric of the PUMA Rise Nitro is, we never expected it to survive our Dremel test. But the shoe managed to surprise us by heroically withstanding the 12-second torture. Your browser does not support the video tag. This PUMA shoe ended up with pretty moderate damage whereas the fabric on another shoe was torn completely. Due to its high resistance to abrasion, the Rise Nitro earned a solid 3 out of 5 for toebox durability. PUMA Rise Nitro vs. Nike Precision 6 Test results Rise Nitro 3 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability Another pleasant surprise was the shoe's heel padding durability. Given how much rubbing is going on in this part of the shoe, we anticipate that the PUMA Rise Nitro will not break down that easily. Assessing how much wear and tear the Dremel left on the shoe's heel padding, we rated its durability as 3 out of 5. That's an average result among our lab-tested hoop shoes. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Rise Nitro 3 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness WARNING: This is the softest rubber in the history of basketball shoe rubbers! Stay away from outdoor courts! We strongly recommend limiting the use of this PUMA shoe to indoors only because the rubber compound that composes the outsole is REALLY soft. Pressing our durometer against the outsole, we found that it is only hard by 68.4 HC. This is 17% softer than our average lab result! Test results Rise Nitro 68.4 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole thickness It seems like the brand tried to compensate for the soft rubber by making it thicker than average. Measuring the outsole thickness with a caliper, we got a reading of 4.6 mm. This is nearly a millimeter thicker than average. But we honestly don't think that this is going to help make the shoe more durable for outdoors. The grooves making up the shoe's tread pattern are quite thin too. Test results Rise Nitro 4.6 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness For added cushioning, the PUMA Rise Nitro features a well-padded insole. Measuring its thickness with a caliper, we found it to be 4.9 mm thick. This is a little thicker than average. Test results Rise Nitro 4.9 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole The insole is super easy to take out in the PUMA Rise Nitro. The shoe accommodates custom inserts and orthotics. Test results Rise Nitro Yes Tongue padding With a thickness of 11.2 mm, we found that the tongue is extra padded in the PUMA Rise Nitro. It works together with the generous collar padding to provide a super cozy and secure in-shoe experience. Test results Rise Nitro 11.2 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type The shoe's gusseted tongue is a very welcome feature. We felt like it added an extra layer of foot lockdown.

These players are better off with shoes that are made for bigger guys like the Nike Ja 1 . Your browser does not support the video tag. Those who want more support can also go for the Ja 1, but the Nike LeBron 20 is an even better pick. Those who do not want to spend a lot to break in their shoes are better served by the Nike KD 15 . We found that this basketball shoe requires very little to no break-in time. Bite that you can rely on Upon our wear tests, we discovered that the outsole still has to be warmed up or broken in just a tiny bit before traction becomes really really good and almost top-tier. On clean courts, though, the bite is absolutely amazing. Your browser does not support the video tag. We even believe that traction is one, if not the best feature of Nike Cosmic Unity 2. Be mindful of dust, though On dirtier courts, traction is still dependable; however, we found that there is still a need for a few quick and easy wipes if consistency is desired. Your browser does not support the video tag. Breathable enough As you can see, the smoke is mostly coming out from the tongue area of the shoe, not so much from the toebox. So, even though it's not a super breezy shoe, it ventilates just enough to prevent you from getting toasty. Your browser does not support the video tag. See how the entire length of the tongue is punctured with ventilation holes. Your browser does not support the video tag. You MAY take the Nike Cosmic Unity 2 outdoors While we think that the Nike Cosmic Unity 2 is not the best option for outdoor usage, it still won't be a terrible choice. We attest that the materials are durable enough to take occasional beatings on harsher outdoor courts. Your browser does not support the video tag. Heel-to-toe transition is smooth We observed that our every step was very smooth because of the nice curved shape on both the rear and front ends of the shoe. The overall structure of the Cosmic Unity 2 is not super clunky. Your browser does not support the video tag. A fairly flexible sole helps in making transitions smooth by allowing the foot to bend where it needs to. Your browser does not support the video tag. The Nike Cosmic Unity 2 is 14% more flexible than basketball shoes on average. Your browser does not support the video tag. A good combo of court feel and bounce The cushioning system is also one of the highlights of the Nike Cosmic Unity 2, as we felt that it's actually pretty bouncy. But the shoe is not just about energy return. Your browser does not support the video tag. While we consider that the energized Zoom is the star of the show, the foam carrier is a great supporting act. To be more specific, Zoom is responsible for a ton of responsive cushion but the carrier foam makes the experience better through its role in retaining a ton of court feel. Your browser does not support the video tag. The shoe is also only 18.2 mm thick in the forefoot which is 2.3 mm thinner than the average. A more low-profile forefoot platform increases ground feedback too. There's some good impact protection there We found that this Nike basketball shoe is very effective in protecting the foot during hard landings. Your browser does not support the video tag. We measured the shoe's heel stack height at 25.2 mm which is a little thinner than the average for basketball shoes (27.5 mm). It's not the most generously cushioned shoe but there is enough to keep you comfortable and supported. Disclaimer: We always include the insole in the stack measurement. The Nike Cosmic Unity 2 has a drop-in insole that delivers great step-in comfort and a lot of compression during our games. This makes wearing the shoe such a comfortable experience. This add-on feature also protects us from impact during our landings and hard strikes. The insole on the Cosmic Unity 2 is 5.2 mm, 1 mm thicker than the average (4.2 mm). However, the shoe's cushioning is also not from the soft bunch. Our durometer measurement shows that it is 6% firmer than the average. Cosmic Unity 2: Quality and comfort Though it's a little stiff initially, we feel that the upper is very very soft and super comfortable once we break in the shoe. Also, the feel of the materials is not cheap at all. We actually consider its quality to be absolutely amazing. Wide-footers, stay away! Cosmic Unity 2 from Nike is an outrageously narrow basketball shoe. We had to go at least half a size up to get the fit that works best for us. Given these, we are inclined to believe that it is safe for players with wide feet to make the same size adjustments or just go for another shoe altogether. Foot containment needs improvement Aside from being too narrow at times, we feel like the comfortable materials in the upper are too flexible yet too unstable to provide a truly dependable lockdown. Your browser does not support the video tag. Lighter and shiftier players may be able to find to workaround, but we think it's better to expect a less-than-stellar support experience. Your browser does not support the video tag. Feel light with the Cosmic Unity 2 The Cosmic Unity 2 from Nike weighs only 12.1 oz or 343 grams, which is a little more than an ounce lighter than our 13.5 or 383 grams average. Those who are looking for lighter kicks are not going to be disappointed.

This third iteration features a reinforced and durable upper that offers a snug fit and a wonderful lockdown feel. This surefootedness also comes from all the padding it has, as well as from its magnificent ankle support. Our surprise when we were testing this Jordan pair was not only the sole flare in the forefoot, but also in the midfoot! We felt incredibly stable when we landed, and the big Zoom Air unit located in the ball of the foot provided us with some bounce every time we went for a quick move. The only drawback here is that such a close-to-the-foot structure and solid upper mean that wide-foot hoopers will most likely feel uncomfortable and cramped in the Zion 3. Pros Pretty good traction on any court Very reinforced and durable upper Formula 23 foam with some bounce Wonderful side-to-side stability Snug fit with padded interiors Very comfortable Incredible lockdown feel Smooth and easy transitions Great ankle support Cons Not for wide feet No toedrag protection Upper doesn't give in Audience verdict 68 Bad!

A very reinforced and durable upper that holds your feet in place. A grippy outsole and a flexible ball of the foot area to go for aggressive moves. A bigger-than-average Zoom Air Unit! Who should NOT buy Absolutely forget about this shoe if you've got wide feet! Our standard-sized ones already felt pretty caged in such a snug fit. Additionally, the Zion 3's solid upper materials don't give in with time, just a slightly bit, but in no way near enough to accommodate big-toed hoopers! If you still want a signature shoe of a crazy good baller, the Jordan Luka 2 might be worth checking out! Your browser does not support the video tag. If you want to play streetball and you need some extra protection on the sides because you're a toe-dragger, just like us, then this Jordan pair might not be the best. All these shoes are good for streetball , and if you're a hardcore Jordan fan, maybe try the Zion 2 ! You know, this line is just constantly evolving, and its zero consistency might as well be part of its magic! Cushioning Heel stack Our caliper returned 25.7 mm when we measured the Zion 3's heel stack, which means it's lower than average. During our wear tests, we found it still provided enough impact protection to jump fearlessly during our games. Once again, we don't want to spoil the content of other sections beforehand, but we just can't help it... wait until you see this Jordan's midsole! Test results Zion 3 25.7 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack The forefoot stack followed the same path as its heel counterpart, as our caliper showed another result which is lower than average. At 15.5 mm, our toes felt pretty close to the ground. We also enjoyed some bounce, even if it wasn't much, on our toe-offs, which made our quick cuts and layups more explosive. This is thanks to the Zoom Air unit we can see right between the caliper claws in the picture. That small white piece offered comfort, shock absorption, and a little bit of a springy feel underfoot. Test results Zion 3 15.5 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop After measuring both the heel and the forefoot stacks, we calculated the Zion 3's drop. Even though 10.2 mm sounds like a lot, this shoe didn't feel weird underfoot. We didn't have to get used to it or things like that, and we could enjoy it from the very first minute. The difference in height between the forefoot and the rearfoot can be seen clearly in this picture. Still, do you know what surprised us the most? The fact that the midsole is kind of... floating out there? Like, look at the heel, it's definitely not glued to the shoe! Test results Zion 3 10.2 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. One of the most interesting parts of the Zion 3 is its midsole/insole. In all honesty, if we didn't cut every shoe by half we might as well have missed it! First of all, when we pressed our durometer against the Formula 23 foam of this Jordan pair, it returned 19 HA. This score is incredibly low, which means this hooper is going to feel soft underfoot. Your browser does not support the video tag. And we totally agree! After playing multiple games in it, the Zion 3 is definitely a comfortable and soft bball pal. As it's not attached to anything, which we found really weird, we could literally just grab the midsole and take it out of the shoe without having to fight its last. Your browser does not support the video tag. Believe us, we were just as confused as you might be right now! This midsole is designed just like a boat or a cradle for your feet. It features a bigger-than-average Zoom Air unit on the forefoot, and we believe this specific piece focuses not only on providing some bounce and impact protection, but also on comfort. Test results Zion 3 19.0 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Jordan Zion 3 fits half size small (124 votes). Consider sizing up Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit A narrow base comes with a narrow upper, and we could definitely feel the Zion 3's snug fit. Your browser does not support the video tag. This was confirmed by the gel replica of the shoe's interiors as the caliper showed only 88.9 mm in the widest part. Considering that wide options are not available for this Jordan shoe, we recommend that wide-footed hoopers skip this pair. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Zion 3 88.9 mm Average 92.8 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 88.9 mm Width / Fit 96.6 mm Toebox width The Zion 3 also gets proportionally narrower near the big toe with a below-average reading of 64.8 mm. This contributes to the shoe's snug and pointy toebox fit and limits its target audience to players with slimmer feet. New test (recommended) Old test Test results Zion 3 64.8 mm Average 69.3 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 64.2 mm Toebox width 72.6 mm Toebox height Gladly, the verical space of this Jordan shoe isn't as shallow as it could have been. We got a slightly lower-than-average reading of 24.8 mm. Test results Zion 3 24.8 mm Average 23.4 mm Compared to 28 basketball shoes Number of shoes 20.1 mm Toebox height 27.4 mm Flexibility / Stiffness Even though this shoe's materials are durable and it offers great stability, we didn't have any problems when we flexed the ball of the foot to perform any kind of move. We really appreciate this during our wear tests, as it allowed us to go for pump fakes or jab steps (between any others) easily from minute one. Your browser does not support the video tag. When we took it to our lab, we saw the Zion 3 only needed 17.6N to bend all the way up to 90 degrees. This is an incredible 55% less force than average! It translated into smooth transitions and the slightest speedy feel. We know we've mentioned before that this pair is not the fastest shoe out there, and we haven't changed our mind, yet we believe this feel comes from the pliability at the ball of the foot (and the Zoom Air unit with its slightly bouncy toe-offs!). Your browser does not support the video tag. This shoe follows methodology 1.8. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Zion 3 17.6N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight We can't say we felt this shoe fast during our wear tests. When we hooped with it, it was more of a \"okay my feet are on the ground\" feel than a \"I think I might as well fly\" one. When we took it to our lab, our scale easily explained why. At 13.5 oz/383g, it's still slightly lighter than average, but our feet wouldn't have said so if they could talk. It didn't drag our feet down or anything, but honestly, it just didn't feel as swift as other hoopers, like the UA Curry 11 for example. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Zion 3 13.5 oz (383g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability Just by having a quick look at its upper, we could already imagine this wouldn't be the most breathable Jordan pair. Your browser does not support the video tag. Our light test showed clearly that there are no ventilation holes in the upper, as the light couldn't go through the textile material. Actually, we only saw it shine through the midsole! Which was pretty surprising, we're not gonna lie. Your browser does not support the video tag. But that didn't save the Zion 3 from choking with the smoke of our machine. On the other hand, the unbeatable UA Curry 10 showed it how it's done scoring a perfect 5/5 on our breathability test. Even though the Jordan pair couldn't get much smoke out at the beginning, it started releasing a solid column after a while. This saved it from the lowest score, so we've given it a 2/5 on the breathability test. When we grabbed our microscope and checked the textile upper, all we could do was agree with our light: no ventilation holes. There's no way the air can freely get through that tightly woven pattern! Test results Zion 3 2 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test The Zion 3 feels pretty supportive! We verified it during our wear tests playing basketball, as its structure doesn't give in at all. Your browser does not support the video tag. This is positive and negative at the same time. On the one hand, it's good because it held our feet in place, so we didn't have to worry about twisting our ankles due to instability. On the other hand, it's bad for wide-feet people as its upper materials are not stretchy. So, don't expect something stretchy that will adapt to your feet. The Zion 3 has a narrow design with a tough textile that will keep your feet in place! To add some stability points, this shoe features two sole flares. One is in the forefoot, which is something that we regularly see on basketball shoes. But the other one is in the midfoot! We definitely don't see this every day, yet we appreciated it a lot during our wear tests. It offered us a wider base to land on, so we didn't lose our balance even after a harsh jump rebounding. You know, those when you hit someone mid-air and try to land without falling or stumbling on someone else! Your browser does not support the video tag. Torsional rigidity Despite the sole flare and the lateral rubberized walls of the shoe, its torsional rigidity levels were definitely not high! Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see, it wasn't hard for us to twist and bend the Zion 3 in our lab. We believe part of this flexibility might come from the gap in the middle of the rubber, as it gave the structure a specific point to surrender to our attempts to bend it. Test results Zion 3 2 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness We gave this Jordan pair a 3/5 on our heel counter stiffness test. Why? Well, basically because of its sides, as they bowed down easily when we applied pressure. Your browser does not support the video tag. Nevertheless, the area of the Achilles stayed still even if we tried hard to push it down. Overall, the Zion 3 undoubtedly offers a snug fit: not only due to its narrow design, but also because of all the inner padding it includes and its thick heel counter. Your browser does not support the video tag. As you can see, it features a big padded pad in the inner padding (a very suitable tongue twister, indeed). This piece held our ankles in place, which helped us go for more daring moves, as we felt supported on every step. And by the way, no heel slippage! Test results Zion 3 3 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot We've mentioned it before: this shoe is narrow! And so is its platform. At 110.0 mm, our caliper indicated it's narrower than average. We didn't feel unstable in it, but we believe this might not be the best option for wide-foot hoopers. Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Zion 3 110.0 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel With a midsole width in the heel that goes down to the scary figure of 80.0 mm, we're now positive the Zion 3 wasn't designed with big feet players in mind. It's become even narrower than its predecessor . But you know, this line keeps changing its shoes as if they belonged to different players. If it wasn't for the name, we wouldn't have guessed that the Zion 1, 2, and 3 were siblings! Your browser does not support the video tag. Test results Zion 3 80.0 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability After a disappointing score on breathability, we did expect this shoe's upper to put up a fight against our lab's champ: the Dremel! Your browser does not support the video tag. 10 seconds were clearly not enough for the tool to destroy this shoe's upper. Despite the 3.2N of force and 5K RPM, the Zion 3 wasn't defeated. As you can see, the Dremel did damage the textile, but it wasn't enough to make a hole or have a negative effect on the shoe's integrity. In other words: the Zion 3 can say proudly that it's a Dremel survivor! Which is way more than what the Nike Precision 6 can say... Just look at this comparison. On the left, we have the Zion 3 and its slightly messed upper, which obtained a nice 4/5 on our toebox durability test. On the right, the Precision 6 and that crater... so we could only give it a 1/5 on this same test. Test results Zion 3 4 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability Even though we always take into account all the abrasion the heel of a shoe has to endure, we couldn't help but have high expectations after the score of the previous test. It's true that in basketball, pretty much every move means constant friction of the Achilles against the heel area. That's why the shoes of this category need a protected and supportive heel padding. Your browser does not support the video tag. After our 5-second Dremel test, the heel padding was left pretty much untouched! The 5K RPM and 3.2N of force of the tool were not enough to mess it up. We could barely see the damages! After careful consideration, we've decided to give the Zion 3 a perfect 5/5 on our heel padding durability test. In case you want to see what the total opposite looks like, the Reebok Answer DMX got obliterated by our Dremel, and it earned a sad 1/5 on this same test. Just look! Test results Zion 3 5 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness To measure every shoe's outsole hardness, we use our durometer. Carefully sticking this small device into the rubber, it returned 77.1 HC, which is a result lower than average. A low durometer reading usually indicates the hooper focuses on traction, and a higher number means it'll be more durable. In this case, we believe it translates into a healthy mix of grip and durability. Your browser does not support the video tag. But hey, no spoilers! We'll tell you about the results of our wear tests later on, stay tuned! Test results Zion 3 77.1 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability Among all the tests that we made the Zion 3 go through, this one might just be the most impressive. Your browser does not support the video tag. After the 20-second drill session at 10K RPM and with 3.2N of force, we put the tool aside to see the damage it had caused. And wow! It's not like we had some bad expectations, but honestly, such a good result is very uncommon! Can you even spot the dent? When we measured it with our tread gauge, it returned a minimal 0.4 mm. In terms of playability, this means the outsole is ready to last and withstand the abrasion of harsh courts! Test results Zion 3 0.4 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness After seeing the incredible durability of the outsole, we understood why the brand decided to go for a thinner piece of rubber. Our caliper returned 3.2 mm, which is lower than average. But, after using such a durable rubber compound, why would Jordan go for a thicker outsole? This would just increase the overall weight of the shoe, as the material is already hard enough to resist the abrasion. Test results Zion 3 3.2 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness As the blue piece we were talking about is the only thing that separated our feet from the outsole, we believe it acts as both the midsole and the insole of this shoe, as it's actually removable. At 20.8 mm, it's obviously way bigger than average. The brand definitely went for the right choice here, as we needed a soft and supportive layer between our feet and the outsole! If just one piece is going to act as a midsole and an insole, it better be thick! Test results Zion 3 20.8 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole The midsole/insole of this Jordan pair is removable! Nevertheless, it's such a special feature, that we would definitely not take it out! As we've mentioned, it acts as a midsole and an insole, and it also features a Zoom Air unit and a shank. Finding a suitable orthotic to substitute this piece might be more than challenging! Test results Zion 3 Yes Reflective elements There are no reflective elements in the Zion 3. That might be the only feature that these signature siblings share! Test results Zion 3 No Tongue padding The tongue followed the same logic, as its design was most likely focused on saving some weight. At 6.9 mm, we felt its padding protected us from any kind of lace bite or hot spots whenever we played, and our instep was also very comfortable. What else could we ask for? We also found the design of the tongue really cool, as it features the Jumpman logo at the front, with the number 3 of this iteration. And on the inside, there's this motivational quote: \"Shock the world\". Test results Zion 3 6.9 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type Despite its price, this shoe features a non-gusseted tongue. If you've read some other reviews of ours, you might know that we usually complain about this whenever it's not a budget shoe we're talking about. Nevertheless, in the case of the Zion 3, which is a very padded, narrow, tough, and not-so-light shoe, we believe the brand made the right choice here. Test results Zion 3 None Heel tab This shoe doesn't have a heel tab. With its snug fit and tough materials, we think adding one wouldn't be a wrong choice. Still, as the Zion 3 features a non-gusseted tongue, our feet had plenty of space to get in and out.

Athletes who do not have the time to break in their shoes wouldn't be fans of the Air Max Impact 4. We believe that they are better off with the Luka 1 from Jordan or the Zoom Freak 4 from Nike . Overall performance? The Air Max Impact 4 simply is it! We are happy with how this budget shoe performs. For a pair under a hundred bucks, we are very impressed at how it works, especially in the court. A perfect example would be the wear resistance of this shoe's upper. Your browser does not support the video tag. After being exposed to a Dremel for 10 seconds at a speed of 10000 RMP, we observed that the Air Max Impact 4 came out less damaged than its more expensive counterpart, the Lebron Witness 7 . We put a piece of white material inside both shoes to prevent the shoe's colorway from getting in the way of the test. As you can see, the Dremel never got to the white part in the Impact 4 (left). In addition, the microscope shot reveals some durable-looking threads woven into the shoe's upper fabric. Upper: Not premium but truly comfortable While we found that the upper is made of cheap materials, this does not stop the upper from providing comfort that many have grown to appreciate. Your browser does not support the video tag. We recognized the breathability of the mesh although it needed a little break-in time. Your browser does not support the video tag. Nike did make sure to supply this shoe with sufficient ventilation. Based on the amount of smoke passing through its upper in our breathability test below, we rated it as 3 out of 5 (5 being the most breathable). Your browser does not support the video tag. Nike Air Max Impact 4 (quite breathable) vs. Nike Lebron NXXT GEN (barely breathable) And just look at the shoe's massive tongue! With a thickness of 11.7 mm, it is notably more padded than the average 9.5 mm. ...and it's quite supportive, too! Besides providing comfort, the upper materials also deliver dependable foot containment. Your browser does not support the video tag. The lockdown we experienced on this shoe is just on point. Your browser does not support the video tag. The shoe's various support features effectively work together to keep our feet securely in their place even during aggressive motion. Some of these features include: moderately stiff heel counter (we rated it as 3 out of 5) Your browser does not support the video tag. supportive panels on each side: rubber in the forefoot and foam in the heel outriggers on the sole (measuring 113.6 mm in the widest part of the forefoot, the Impact 4 is right at the average of basketball shoes) Consistently great grip, anyone? We were also in awe of the outsole of the Air Max Impact 4 as it has really great multi-directional coverage. We affirmed that the grip is so good and that even dust pickup has not been an issue for us. There is no need to keep on wiping the sole just to keep it grippy. Your browser does not support the video tag. Amazing spring back with the Air Max Impact 4! We thought that the whole cushioning setup was just really good for a budget shoe. We found the shoe bouncy and reactive around the forefoot, making it truly suitable for quick changes in direction and aggressive sprints toward the basket. Your browser does not support the video tag. Based on our lab test of the shoe's cushioning, the foam used on the Impact 4 is 12% softer than the average of our tested basketball shoes. Disclaimer: We repeat the durometer measurement four times, excluding the outliers, and take the average number for our final result. The photo above shows just one of such measurements. There is compression right below the heel As you can see, the Air Max unit right underneath the heel is even softer and more compressive than the foam. It provides that area with the impact protection that it needs during harsh landings and aggressive strikes. Your browser does not support the video tag. The use of Air Max also increases the stack height of this basketball shoe, elevating the heel for extra comfort. Using a pair of calipers, we measured the heel stack height at 33.3 mm (4.6 mm thicker than average) and its forefoot at 23.8 mm (2.3 mm thicker). This also means that the Nike Air Max Impact 4 has a higher-than-average drop of 9.5 mm. The average for basketball shoes is 7.2 mm. Approved for outdoor use Based on our games, the Nike Air Max Impact 4, especially its outsole, offers plenty of durability. Due to this, we also believe that it's a really wonderful outdoor option. For its moderate price, this hoop shoe from Nike boasts a fairly thick and hard rubber outsole. We measured its thickness at 3.4 mm in the heel (the average is 3.9 mm) But it's the hardness that impressed us the most. Based on our durometer measurement, the Impact 4's rubber is harder than 88% of our lab-tested hoop shoes! That is a clear go signal for outdoor courts. A good flex is there too Stiffness is not something we were worried about in the Nike Air Max Impact 4. There is a good amount of flex where you most need it - under the ball of the foot. Your browser does not support the video tag. Disclaimer: We take four measurements with the gauge and calculate the average, excluding the outliers. The video above shows one of the measurements. Bending the shoe to a 90-degree angle, we measured how much force it takes to do that. In the case of the Impact 4, it is 25.5% less resistant (=more flexible) compared to other basketball shoes. Your browser does not support the video tag. In addition to the gauge test above, we also perform a manual assessment. Bending the shoe, we rated its longitudinal flexibility as 3 out of 5 (where 5 is the stiffest). And twisting it, we assessed torsional flex as 4 out 5 (a little more stiffness here is good for stability). Air Max Impact 4: Worth every penny! The Air Max Impact 4 from Nike is enduring proof that a shoe does not have to be expensive to be effective on the court. As mentioned, it is made only of budget-appropriate materials and technologies, but it still ends up as a shoe that can hold its own candle even when compared to far more expensive models from Nike and other brands. Purchasing this is not a bad decision.

Cut 2 fits slightly small (69 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Who should buy the Nike Air Zoom G.T. Cut 2 Just like the original GT Cut, this shoe is part of a trio of shoes that target different key basketball functions. The Nike Air Zoom G.T. Cut 2 is most suited for the following: people who play really low to the ground players who are shifty and do a lot of quick footwork wearers who appreciate a snug, one-to-one fit Who should NOT buy this basketball shoe from Nike The Nike Air Zoom G.T. Cut 2 is not for players who need very high levels of support and lockdown. And if you have weak ankles or just want a shoe that moves as one unit, we suggest going for the Nike KD 15 or the Nike Zoom Freak 4 instead. Your browser does not support the video tag. Both of these alternatives are also lighter than average, solving another problem with the G.T. Cut 2 - its weight. Really plush and bouncy We are thoroughly satisfied with the very plush ride and the overall cushioning system this shoe offers. We believe that this shoe has one of the best bounce and impact protection on the market. Your browser does not support the video tag. The cushioning setup on this Nike shoe is VERY complex. It includes the following components (listed as they appear in the shoe from top to bottom): a plush React drop-in midsole right underneath the foot (red) a small Zoom Air unit in the heel of that drop-in midsole (small white piece) a carrier made of firmer Phylon foam (grey) a full-length Zoom Strobel (white) a shank for stability (dark grey) The drop-in React component is very different from a regular shoe insole. It is a thick foam layer (8.6 mm in the heel) that provides primary cushioning in the Air Zoom G.T. Cut 2. With the help of a durometer, we found that the React drop-in midsole is very soft indeed. This foam is even 39% plusher than the average of our lab-tested shoes! The plush React is contained inside the firmer Phylon foam. Being 57% firmer, it acts as a carrier to prevent wobbliness. Disclaimer: We repeat the durometer measurements four times and take down the average, excluding any outliers. The photo above shows one of the measurements. Stability is not where the G.T. Cut 2 shines Unfortunately, Nike seems to have gone too far with the plushness and complexity of this shoe's cushioning. We discovered that G.T. Cut 2 is more advantageous for footwork rather than air assaults and jumping due to the shoe's cushioning. Your browser does not support the video tag. What does this mean? While the drop-in midsole and the malleable upper bestow comfort and more freedom, they also result in unnecessary shifts during strikes and takeoffs. Your browser does not support the video tag. Because of this, we consider stability a touchy subject with the Air Zoom G.T. Cut 2. There is way too much going on underfoot. And while some players might actually prefer this kind of setup, people with weaker ankles should steer clear of this Nike shoe. We felt like we were too high up off the ground because of all the cushioning layers. But in reality, the G.T. Cut 2 has an average stack height for a basketball shoe. In the heel, we measured it at 27.8 mm (average: 28.7 mm), and in the forefoot, it is 22 mm thick (21.5 mm). Foot containment may not be optimal either A comfortable and malleable upper has its price. For the Nike Air Zoom G.T. Cut 2, having such an upper meant that support is not at the ideal level. While it's not totally absent, we definitely feel the upper swaying with our movements, especially when we start to get more intense and aggressive. On the bright side, the external heel counter plays its part in holding down our ankles. We rated its stiffness as 3 out of 5 (where 5 is the stiffest). Your browser does not support the video tag. Grip is what you can trust in the Nike G.T. Cut 2 As long as the outsole rubber gets the warming up that it needs, we observed that it is able to grip every surface pretty much equally. We verified that the traction patterns sculpted in the outsole are truly ideal for fluid footwork, as they did a great job of biting the floor, especially when the court is clean and dust-free. It might be bottom-heavy... But the downside to the shoe's pronounced traction patterns is that there is so much stuff going on at the bottom part of the shoe. We felt like much of the shoe's weight was concentrated in that area. Due to this, we warn players who do a lot of runs, as they may not have that much fun while wearing the Nike Air Zoom G.T. Cut 2. Measuring the outsole rubber, we found that its thickness is average in the heel. But in the forefoot, the coral-colored rubber gets twice as thick! This is a very burly outsole design for a basketball shoe. ...but it's outdoor-ready! But that large helping of rubber is not only there to make the shoe heavier. Using a durometer, we measured the hardness of this rubber and found it to be firmer than 50% of our lab-tested basketball shoes! The G.T. Cut 2 is definitely ready for some outdoor wear and tear. Just be careful not to toe drag too much. Avoid toe dragging The shoe's TPU threads got us really excited at first. Especially when we looked at them through a microscope: Compared to many other basketball shoes that we've tested, this type of material looked promising. But unfortunately, it never stood up to our durability test. Your browser does not support the video tag. The shoe ended up with the same hole as a regular non-protected knit upper. Nike G.T. Cut 2 (left) got damaged in the same way as the cheaper Nike Lebron Witness 7 Breathability and in-shoe comfort are guaranteed Because the upper is a little bit more expandable, it does not feel constricting at all. We found that the upper has more give, so it is able to accommodate different foot shapes and sizes. The materials used in the upper are also really breathable and feel really nice on our feet. Your browser does not support the video tag. Equipped with a smoke-pumping machine, we tested the shoe's breathability by how much smoke was able to pass through its upper. On a 1-5 scale where 5 is the most breathable, we rated this Nike shoe as 3. Not like it's perfect for a hot summer day but it is a little more ventilated than basketball shoes on average (3.8). Your browser does not support the video tag. Nike Air Zoom G.T. Cut 2 (left) vs. the less breathable Nike Lebron NXXT GEN (right) Special shoutout to the strong laces We can't help but notice that the laces of the GT Cut 2 are super strong. We didn't have problems with them getting untied during motion. Enjoy the 1-to-1 fit of the Nike Air Zoom G.T. Cut 2 In our games, this pair didn't feel narrow and constricting. As a matter of fact, even the broad footers among us testers were able to go true to size. When it comes to inserting orthotics, we thought that it wasn't the most accommodating, though. Looking at the widest part of the forefoot, the G.T. Cut 2 is a few millimeters wider than average. And near the big toe, it is just about the same as the average. We can confirm that this basketball shoe has a solid medium width with a little bit of give. The tongue wouldn't stay locked We were frustrated with the shoe's tongue which tends to fold on the edges and slide to the side. A kind of gusset would have been nice.

Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Who should buy the Nike KD 15 Given its strengths and weaknesses, the Nike KD 15 is apparently for the following: basketball players who have narrow to normal-sized feet hoopers who enjoy generous cushioning that's a little more on the soft side Who should NOT buy this basketball shoe from Nike Your browser does not support the video tag. We don't expect those with wide feet to enjoy the KD 15 or any shoe from the KD line for that matter. Kevin Durant's feet, the obvious basis for the shoe's design, are recognized by fans for being narrow. The Cosmic Unity is a good alternative. Other reasonable options that we could think of are the Nike Ja 1 and most of the shoes from LeBron James's multiple shoe lines with Nike. The KD 15 offers a great bite anytime, anywhere We are more than glad that the 15th KD signature shoe from Nike is gripping super well on different surfaces What really excites us is the fact that dust pickup is not that much of a problem and that little to no wiping is necessary to maintain the outsole's beastly grip. Your browser does not support the video tag. We discovered that this shoe has a ton of grip o n the indoor hardwood and the rougher outdoor courts. Not bad for outdoors Frequent outdoor use of the KD 15 is something we don't recommend, though, because there is not that much rubber in the outsole. We measured outsole thickness at 4.2 mm which is actually thicker than on some of the other Nike basketball shoes, like the Cosmic Unity 2 (3.0 mm). The latter is considered to be OK for outdoors. Thus, the KD 15 may not be such a disaster if you play outdoors occasionally. We also tested how stiff the rubber is. It turns out to be on the firmer side actually, which is also a good sign for durability. Softer shoes tend to be grippier but don't last as long. Disclaimer: We take the durometer measurement 5 times to ensure accuracy. Not-so breathable figure-hugging upper Straight out of the box, we observe that the Nike KD 15 feels a bit softer than the KD 14 and that it needs very little to no break-in time. The 15's upper generally feels minimal and is able to conform well to the shape of the foot. Because of this, comfort is ensured. Your browser does not support the video tag. However, as you can see, the smoke is only coming through the tongue area. There is not much ventilation in the toebox. Your browser does not support the video tag. Underfoot comfort is a priority for the Nike KD 15 Compared to the Nike KD 14, we feel that the 15 has more cushioning, so impact protection is also more pronounced. The harshness of our aggressive heel strikes and hard landings are mitigated, so we don't feel pain. The heel stack of the KD 15 is 26.7 mm, while the forefoot is 20.5 mm. This is right at the average of our lab-tested basketball shoes. So, there is indeed a good amount of cushioning. Disclaimer: We also measure the midsole stack with the insole included. At 5.1 mm, the insole on the KD 15 is thicker than the average (4.2 mm) which definitely contributes to underfoot protection and comfort. Bounce is pronounced We verified that the whole midsole setup delivers more spring back, thanks to the efficient design of the midsole. Your browser does not support the video tag. Our feet witnessed incredible bounce and responsiveness when we wore this KD shoe, all thanks to the Nike Strobel, which we found nothing like it in the market today. Your browser does not support the video tag. One of the factors that contribute to our bouncy experience is the cushioning softness. Having checked the shoe's midsole with a durometer, we discovered that it is softer than many other Nike shoes. It is 9% softer than the average Not so flexible The KD 15 has got to be one of the stiffest basketball shoes we have ever tried from Nike. Your browser does not support the video tag. Based on our flexibility measurement, it is 12% stiffer than our lab-tested basketball shoes on average. Your browser does not support the video tag. Support is not a problem with the 15th KD At first, we were not entirely satisfied with the shoe's support  Fortunately, the cushion eventually softened so some material came up the sides of our foot, hugging it so it stayed in place. We found that the laces were also secure and well-mounted enough to keep the shoe securely on even during aggressive movements. Your browser does not support the video tag. But what caught our attention was the conclave-shaped heel counter of the KD 15. We considered this a super ergonomic and anatomic design element. What it does is allow the foot to sit back into the shoe, locking it securely even if the collar isn't that high to cover a good part of the ankle. Your browser does not support the video tag. Comfortable for non-wide-footers We learned that the minimal-feeling upper delivers comfort only to the testers among us whose feet are not wide. Though we were surprised that the KD 15 is a lot roomier than the previous KDs, it is still on the narrower side. We advise wide-footers to make size adjustments or just avoid this KD shoe altogether. The Nike KD 15 FEELS light We spotted that this Kevin Durant shoe is more streamlined and much quicker, which is why we concluded that this is an absolute home run from Nike. We felt that the Nike KD 15 is the lightest KD ever even if it is not what the shoe's actual weight shows. Your browser does not support the video tag. The KD 15 is at 12.6 oz (357 g), which is way above the average weight of Nike KD shoes which we peg at 12.1 oz (344 g). It is also 20-22 g heavier than the Nike Cosmic Unity 2 and the Air Deldon .

For us, this shoe is a no-brainer, especially since we are suckers for classic leather silhouettes that are immensely durable and supportive. Even though this Reebok shoe falls short of proper cushioning and other features of a high-performance hoop shoe, it still performs decent on the court. But if you consider it for your casual sneaker collection, we think that the Answer IV is a fantastic offering with a rich background.

Our current top recommendations are the Nike LeBron 20 and the Adidas Harden Vol. 7 . Your browser does not support the video tag. Another major turnoff of the Reebok Answer IV is its unbearably hot upper. If you need some ventilation inside your basketball shoes, we suggest the Nike Cosmic Unity 3 as a better choice. Cushioning Heel stack Now let's take a look at how much cushioning this Iverson shoe has packed for us. Using a caliper, we measured the shoe's heel stack at 32.2 mm. This is a couple of millimeters thicker than the average; most likely because of that thicker layer of rubber under the heel. Test results Answer IV 32.2 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack In the forefoot, the shoe's stack height becomes thinner, allowing us to get a better court feel. The caliper shows 19.1 mm which is 2.5 mm lower than average. Test results Answer IV 19.1 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop The difference in stack heights that we got was 13.1 mm. This is a bit too steep for a performance-oriented hoop shoe these days. Having this much elevation under the heel detracts from the player's ability to be in touch with the court and adjust the footwork quickly. But after all, the brand is not promoting the Answer IV as a performance shoe. For a casual sneaker, the added heel cushioning is more beneficial as you need that for walking comfortably. Test results Answer IV 13.1 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. Gone are the days of the DMX air-transferring pod technology. The modern-day Reebok Answer IV features its successor, the DMX foam. It is a dual-density setup that uses softer foam for primary cushioning and a firmer component under the heel for better impact protection. Using our durometer, we checked how soft the main foam actually is. With a reading of 22.6 HA, it is in fact 18% plusher than hoop shoes on average. But unfortunately, it doesn't make the Reebok Answer IV feel so comfortable. The shoe, as a whole, doesn't really have any give to it and feels really firm. Your browser does not support the video tag. If you're missing the original DMX air transferring system and want to catch a glimpse of it, the closest shoe we've got to that is the Reebok Answer DMX . It has small air pockets in the forefoot and in the heel. Test results Answer IV 22.6 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Secondary foam softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. Located in the center of the heel, this cushioning component is much firmer than the primary foam. At 32.0 HA, it is actually 17% firmer. Aside from impact protection, it occurs to us that this unit helps to stabilize the rearfoot. Fun fact: It features Allen Iverson's face graphic. Test results Answer IV 32.0 HA Average 27.8 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Size and fit Size Reebok Answer IV fits slightly small (22 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit One of the shoe's pleasant surprises was of course its true-to-size fit. But having medium-width feet, we can only speak for ourselves. Measuring the widest part of the shoe's toebox, we found that it is as much as 7 mm wider than average! Woow! That would've been some real good news for wide-footers, if it wasn't for the the shoe's tapered shape. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Answer IV 108.2 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width Please be informed that the shoe's toebox gets significantly narrower around the toes. Measuring its width at the big-toe mark, we got 72.3 mm which is 4.5 mm narrower than average! That's half a centimeter less space to wiggle your toes. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Answer IV 72.3 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Flexibility / Stiffness Freedom of movement is definitely not listed in this Reebok shoe's constitution. Stiff in both the upper and the sole, the Answer IV did not give in to our flexibility lab test. Using a gauge, we measured how much force it takes to bend the shoe to a 90-degree angle. Just like we expected, it required a great deal more than average! Your browser does not support the video tag. At 55.6N, it took 26% more force than the average hoop shoe. But it's necessarily a bad thing. Some people actually prefer stiffer shoes for the pop that they provide. Walking or dribbling in the Reebok Answer IV, we indeed found it a bit springy. Your browser does not support the video tag. But if your playing style really favors the ability to bend your feet freely, we highly recommend the following shoes: Nike LeBron NXXT GEN (32.4N) Adidas Harden Vol. 7 (34.6N) Under Armour Curry 10 (35.5N) This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Answer IV 55.6N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight Having reviewed beasts like the Reebok Blast (17.5 oz/495g) and the Reebok Question Mid (16.9 oz/479g), we were prepared to see a big number for the Reebok Answer IV too. But it wasn't so bad! Our scale showed 15.1 oz (427g) in a men's US size 9. This is only an ounce heavier than average! Kudos, Reebok! Perhaps that little trick with dual-density rubbers worked? Test results Answer IV 15.1 oz (427g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability We had some questions regarding the Answer IV's breathability. But alas, no answers. As our smoke-pumping machine test shows, this Reebok shoe is stuffy as hell! Its sturdy leather upper retained 98% of the smoke inside the shoe, allowing just a tiny streak to come out through the zipper. Your browser does not support the video tag. This shoe's ventilation is incredibly poor leading us to rate it with the lowest score of 1 out of 5. To back it up, we even hovered half of the shoe over a bright light in search of any hidden ventilation pores. But to no avail. It's still a hot shoe. Your browser does not support the video tag. The Answer IV uses genuine leather for its upper and there are no perforations at all. Test results Answer IV 1 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test If there is one area where it's nearly impossible to criticize the Reebok Answer IV, that would be stability. The shoe's stiff leather upper, firm and rigid sole, TPU shank, and other supportive features make it feel like you've got bowling alley walls around your feet! Your browser does not support the video tag. Also, those sturdy rubberized overlays on the sides (with AI's logos) are not just there for looks either, you know. Torsional rigidity As we mentioned above, this Reebok shoe comes with a stiff TPU shank inside the midsole. This component significantly elevates the shoe's torsional rigidity. So much so, that we gave it a maximum score of 5 out of 5. Forget about twisting ankles in the Reebok Answer IV. Test results Answer IV 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness The shoe also comes with a good amount of rigidity in the heel counter. On a scale from 1 to 5, where 5 is the stiffest, we gave it the average 3. Worry not, it doesn't make the heel hold any worse but it does give a little more breathing room for the ankle. Test results Answer IV 3 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot The landing area of the Answer IV is pretty broad, especially in the forefoot. Measuring the widest part with a caliper, we got 117 mm which is a good 4 mm wider than average. This definitely made us feel surefooted moving laterally. Test results Answer IV 117.0 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel Back in the heel, the Reebok Answer IV doesn't exceed the average width but is still amply wide for a hoop shoe (more so, for a casual sneaker). Our caliper showed 89.7 mm in the widest part of the shoe's midsole in the heel. Test results Answer IV 89.7 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Lockdown The Answer IV’s mid-top silhouette features not one, not two, but THREE lockdown components! We haven't seen this many all at once, on one hoop shoe. Your browser does not support the video tag. First, there is a traditional lacing system. Secondly, it is hidden inside a zipper-covered tongue. And finally, it is all topped with a Velcro strap. Yes, it feels just as secure as it looks. Durability Toebox durability Oh-oh, here she comes! And we are not talking about our shoe-eating Dremel tool this time around. This Reebok shoe's leather is the only monster in this room. After 12 seconds of drilling the Answer IV's toebox at a 5K RPM speed, its wear resistance left us absolutely stunned! The minor scratch that occurred on the material was not enough to lower the shoe's durability score one bit. Thus, it deserves the perfect 5 out of 5 for toebox durability. Your browser does not support the video tag. Let's add some comparisons to the equation. Here is what the exact same Dremel test did to a mesh-covered Adidas shoe. Reebok Answer IV vs. Adidas Harden Stepback 3 At least the shoe on the right gets to be more breathable. Test results Answer IV 5 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability If you're someone who owned a pair of old '90s hoop shoes, you would probably know how after a year or even a few months, its collar lining would start peeling and flaking. The foamy padding becomes exposed and even though the rest of the upper looks unscathed, the overall look of the shoe suffers. Well, that's exactly what we observe in the Reebok Answer IV. The ease at which our Dremel damaged the heel collar lining confirms it. Your browser does not support the video tag. We had to give this part of the shoe a lower durability score of 3 out of 5. Not terrible but a little disappointing for a $170 leather shoe. Test results Answer IV 3 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness Looking at this Reebok shoe's outsole, we found it to be a mixed bag. That's because the Answer IV uses two different types of rubber with very different densities. On the heel, we have a softer compound which returned 64.5 HC on our durometer. That is considered really soft for a hoop shoe and is 26% softer than the average. On the other hand, the forefoot is lined with a super hard rubber which shows 88 HC. That is, on the contrary, 7% harder than the average! This is actually the first time we have seen something like that in our lab. What's the logic behind it? To make heel landings softer? To keep the shoe's weight down? We are not sure, to be honest. But one thing is for sure, the soft rubber makes this Reebok shoe a poor choice for outdoor games. Test results Answer IV 64.5 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability Our statement above is 100% confirmed by our outsole durability test. Having drilled the shoe's rubber at the heel for 22 seconds at a pretty high 10K RPM speed, we saw some notable damage. Your browser does not support the video tag. A tread gauge tool helped us measure the depth of this damage and it turned out to be as deep as 2.3 mm, more than a millimeter deeper than average! Definitely not concrete-ready! Unless we're talking about casual wear. Test results Answer IV 2.3 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness It was pretty wise for Reebok to make that soft rubber layer thicker. Because it melts like ice cream! Our caliper shows a whopping 6.9 mm of rubber thickness under the heel. The hard forefoot rubber, however, is much thinner. Based on our measurement, it comes in at 3.7 mm which is about the same as the average of basketball shoes. Test results Answer IV 6.9 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness From our experience, the shoe's default insole doesn't do much to make underfoot experience softer. But it's not bad either. Measuring its thickness in the heel, we got 4.4 mm. This is pretty much the same as the average. Test results Answer IV 4.4 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole Like we said in the cushioning sections above, this Reebok shoe feels firm underfoot. But the good news is that you have the option to elevate comfort by swapping the shoe's insole. Test results Answer IV Yes Reflective elements Wow! We don't see reflective elements on basketball shoes every day! But now we got one on the Answer IV and it is big! The entire side overlay lights up in the dar, also highlighting Iverson's logo. Pretty dope! Test results Answer IV Yes Tongue padding The tongue on the Answer IV has a reasonable thickness. Based on our caliper measurement, it is 7.5 mm thick. About 2 mm thinner than average. To be honest, we were prepared for prepared for a monsterously padded tongue. Like the 15-mm pillow on the Reebok Blast . Test results Answer IV 7.5 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type There are no gussets in this Reebok shoe's tongue. But with that zipper, trust us, there is not even a hint of sliding or bunching. Test results Answer IV None Heel tab A leather finger loop is attach at the back of the shoe. It is finctional but also aesthetically intergrated with the rest of the shoe. Test results Answer IV Finger loop Background The Reebok Answer IV we lab-tested is a revamped rendition of an iconic model. Adorning the outsole is Iverson’s mantra which is also tattooed on his arm – “Only the Strong Survive.” Set into the heel is a black and white imprint of his face that depicts his characteristic cornrows and headband. The side overlays featuring Allen Iverson's \"A.I.\" signature have a swooshy vibe to them. It's like they embody his fast-paced style of a shooting guard. Back in a day, the Reebok Answer IV became an instant classic when he stepped over Tyronn Lue after crossing him over and hitting a go-ahead jumper during the first game of the 2001 NBA Finals.

Your browser does not support the video tag. They are better off with the Nike LeBron 20 and other offers from LeBron James's much-celebrated line of signature shoes. These picks are also good for players who have wide feet. The Precision 6's upper means comfort We found this shoe to be supercomfortable for all day use. After a while, we also noticed that the upper conforms well to the shape of our feet. The tongue feels nice and cozy on top of our feet. And it is also notably more padded than most basketball shoe tongues. We measured it at 11.9 mm which is indeed thicker than the average 9.5 mm. This shoe is simply a delight to wear.

Nike Precision 6 (breathable) vs. Nike Lebron NXXT GEN (barely breathable) Judging by the amount of smoke passing through the fabric, we rated it as 4 out 5 on our breathability scale, where 5 is the most breathable. Upper has no reinforcements After a careful examination, we realized that the upper does not look or feel cheep at all. But then, we took it to the lab! Your browser does not support the video tag. It may not FEEL cheap, but when we put the upper through our Dremel durability test, it quickly revealed its budget-friendly nature. Your browser does not support the video tag. Toe drags are definitely not a good idea in the Nike Precision 6. Nike Precision 6 (affordable shoe) vs. Nike Cosmic Unity 3 (expensive premium-quality shoe) after the same test Taking a close-up microscope shot of the material, it looks like a cute little sweater (not an armored tank). Stable and supportive (one of the widest platforms on the market!) When it comes to foot containment, this shoe has a wide base and a super sharp outrigger that helps keep the foot on the footbed even during the most intense movements. Your browser does not support the video tag. This is one of the widest footprints we've seen in our lab for sure! In the widest part of the forefoot (116.7 mm), this Nike shoe is 4.5 mm wider than average. And in the heel (91 mm), it is 1.4 mm wider. This is a major contributor to the shoe's lateral stability. Your browser does not support the video tag. Our only concern was the lack of stiffness in the shoe's heel counter. In a manual assessment, we rated it as 2 out 5, where 5 is the stiffest. And yet, we never found ankle support or foot containment to be an issue. Your browser does not support the video tag. The grip is highly dependable on clean courts This shoe's traction works, as long as the game is played on indoor and well-kept courts. It's truly grippy on the hardwood. The traction might just be the best feature here. Your browser does not support the video tag. The grip strength gets a bit of a downgrade when there is dust. Wiping helps, immediately. Looks promising for outdoor use! The Nike Precision 6 is full of surprises. We wouldn't expect a budget shoe like this to perform well outdoors but it seems to work just fine! After all, it's got a thick and hard layer of rubber for an outsole. Looking at the rubber thickness at the heel, we found it to be 3.9 mm. This is on par with most of the premium basketball shoes on the market. But what's truly amazing is how hard it is. The rubber on this Nike shoe is by far THE hardest in our collection of basketball shoes! What a nice surprise! Your steps are going to be smooth The Nike Precision 6 has all the characteristics that ensure smooth heel-to-toe transitions: it has rounded ends, the midfoot is stiff, and the forefoot has some flex to it. Your browser does not support the video tag. In our manual flexibility test presented above, we rated the shoe's longitudinal and torsional flexibility as 4 out of 5 (5 being the stiffest). However, our gauge test showed that the Precision 6 is still more flexible than average (by 24%) Your browser does not support the video tag. Disclaimer: We take four measurements and calculate the average, excluding the outliers. The video above shows only one of the measurements. The Precision 6 is all about court feel This is a great shoe for guards. It is low to the ground and it has a great court feel. The tooling is also a bit firm, so its responsiveness is high. Your browser does not support the video tag. Given this, we get more control over our movements, and quick cuts and turns are not difficult to execute. Do expect firm cushioning in the Precision 6. Our durometer test shows that its foam is 11% firmer than the average of our lab-tested basketball shoes. Disclaimer: We take four measurements and calculate the average, excluding the outliers. The photo above shows only one of the measurements. And if you're wondering how tall the shoe's platform actually is, it is quite average. Using a pair of calipers, we measured the heel stack at 27.7 mm (average: 28.7 mm) and its forefoot stack at 21 mm (average: 21.5 mm). The heel-to-toe drop of 6.7 mm is also within the medium range of basketball shoes (7.2 mm). ...but court feel comes with a price The court feel that the Nike Precision 6 delivers comes with a performance setback. Cushioning is kinda stiff and there's not much impact protection. More expensive cushioning technologies are the first to go to bring the price of the shoe down. Indeed, you win some and lose some with this one. Light as a feather At 341 grams (12 oz), the Nike Precision 6 easily puts to shame many basketball shoes on our record. The average weight of basketball shoes is 13.6 oz, that's 386 grams. The shoe is indeed light and responsive, so it's safe to say that this one delivers agility and speed. Get your usual size The Nike Precision 6 has a true-to-size fit, so there is no need for size adjustments unless you have really wide feet. Based on our toebox measurements, the Nike Precision 6 falls into the medium-width category.

We found it too clunky and lacking the technical edge for a proper court game. Your browser does not support the video tag. If you need a basketball shoe for real action, our current top picks are Nike LeBron NXXT GEN and Jordan Zion 2 . Cushioning Heel stack The Reebok Answer DMX keeps beating records! This time around, it tops the list of stack heights in basketball shoes. Based on our caliper measurements, there is a whopping 38.4 mm of stack in the heel! That makes it over 8 mm taller than the average. On foot, this Reebok shoe indeed creates an incredibly cushioned experience. And even though it's not very playable, the Answer DMX will offer tons of impact protection in case you happen to engage in a spontaneous game. Test results Answer DMX 38.4 mm Average 29.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 23.2 mm Heel stack 38.4 mm Forefoot stack The Reebok Answer DMX keeps raising stacks in the forefoot too. According to our caliper measurement, it is 24.7 mm tall under the toes. Also taller than the average but this time by 3 mm. Test results Answer DMX 24.7 mm Average 21.6 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 15.5 mm Forefoot stack 26.8 mm Drop Subtracting the forefoot stack from the heel height, we get a drop of 13.7 mm. This is way taller than the average (by approximately 5.5 mm). That way, the Reebok Answer DMX is the total opposite of being \"low to the ground.\" Such a massive platform and raised heel is much better suited for casual wear these days. Test results Answer DMX 13.7 mm Average 7.5 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 3.9 mm Drop 13.7 mm Midsole softness Note: a low durometer measurement equals a soft material, whereas a high measurement means it's firm. Retro shoe purists may remember the revolutionary (at the time) DMX moving air tech. It was Reebok's own take on Nike's Air cushioning. The DMX comprised a 10-pod setup in which air was transferred from pod to pod when compressed by the foot. That way, more air was transferred to the part of the shoe where it was most needed. The modern-day Reebok Answer DMX we are looking at now uses a more contemporary (and much simpler) variation of the DMX. We can still see air pockets under the heel and forefoot but they are nowhere near the size they used to be. Actually, those round pods you see on the outsole used to be part of the DMX setup but now they only mimic the OG design. The shoe's primary cushioning is now delivered by the DMX Foam. Using a durometer, we measured its softness at 25.1 HA which is nearly the same as the average for basketball shoes. Neither too plush nor firm, it's just a well-balanced, no-nonsense type of cushioning. Test results Answer DMX 25.1 HA Average 25.1 HA We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.0 HA Midsole softness (soft to firm) 38.6 HA Size and fit Size Reebok Answer DMX fits true to size (11 votes). Small True to size Large Owners of this shoe, how does it fit? 1 size small ½ size small True to size ½ size large 1 size large Submit Width / Fit At first look, it may appear that the Reebok Answer DMX is a pointy and constricting shoe. But luckily, our on-foot experience and measurements proved otherwise. In the widest part of the toebox, our caliper showed 100.5 mm which is about the same as the average. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Answer DMX 100.5 mm Average 101.6 mm Compared to 65 basketball shoes Number of shoes 92.6 mm Width / Fit 109.2 mm Toebox width It isn't a very tapered toebox either. Measuring its width around the big toe, we got 76.5 mm which is exactly the same as the average. For our medium-width feet, this Reebok shoe offers an ideal fit. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Answer DMX 76.5 mm Average 76.9 mm Compared to 59 basketball shoes Number of shoes 71.2 mm Toebox width 85.1 mm Flexibility / Stiffness Given the shoe's really chunky leather upper and massively thick midsole, we expected it to be on the stiff side. Surprisingly, it wasn't too far off the average. Your browser does not support the video tag. According to our force gauge, it takes 42.4N to bend the Answer DMX to a 90-degree angle. Only 4% more than it takes on average. We can confirm that there is enough flex to walk comfortably in this shoe. This shoe follows methodology 1.7. It has been replaced with methodology 1.8 (the 'gel test') on more recently updated shoes. Results from the two methodologies cannot be directly compared, which is why you don't see recently tested shoes in the chart below. Test results Answer DMX 42.4N Average 38.8N We use an average of four tests. The video shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 17.6N Flexibility <> Stiffness 62.2N Weight You don't really need a scale to know that the Reebok Answer DMX is a heavy-set shoe. But we still have to check exactly how heavy we're talking. Coming at 16.3 oz (461g) in a men's US size 9, this was not the heaviest Reebok shoe in our catalog (hello Reebok Blast at 17.5 oz!). But it is still 2 ounces heavier than the average basketball shoe and that's a big deal when we're talking about on-court performance. Test results Answer DMX 16.3 oz (461g) Average 13.8 oz (391g) Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 11.3 oz (320g) Weight 17.5 oz (495g) Breathability We gotta be honest, the Reebok Answer DMX seemed like it would get zero for breathability at first sight. But as our smoke-pumping machine test shows, the shoe does let some air pass on the sides of the tongue. It's definitely not enough to keep the interiors ventilated on a warm summer day, but at least it's not a foot oven. Your browser does not support the video tag. On a 1-5 scale, where 5 is the most breathable, we rated this Reebok shoe's breathability as 2. To further demonstrate the shoe's absolute lack of ventilation capacity, we put its half-cut upper against bright light. As you can see, no perforations or mesh sections whatsoever.

Test results Answer DMX 2 Average 2.6 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Breathability 5 Stability Lateral stability test From our on-foot experience, the Reebok Answer DMX's side-to-side stability is unshakeable! From its sturdy and heavily padded upper down to the wide and rigid platform, everything works well together to make this Reebok shoe amazingly stable for lateral movements. Torsional rigidity We gave the shoe's torsional rigidity the highest possible score (5 out of 5) straight away. As our manual test below shows, twisting the shoe with bare hands is nearly impossible. The ANswer DMX made us forget all about feeling shaky or twisting an ankle! Test results Answer DMX 5 Average 4.4 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Torsional rigidity 5 Heel counter stiffness As burly as it may seem, the shoe's heel counter actually has some give to it. Assessing its stiffness in our manual test, we gave it 3 out of 5 because it has a pretty average amount of rigidity for a basketball shoe. It's a very fine balance of ankle hold and pliability for comfort. Test results Answer DMX 3 Average 3.7 Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel counter stiffness 5 Midsole width - forefoot This Reebok shoe features an amply wide platform that's neither too narrow nor wide. According to our caliper, it comes in at 108.5 mm in the widest part of the forefoot. That's about 3 mm narrower than average but didn't cause us any stability issues at all. Test results Answer DMX 108.5 mm Average 114.9 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 106.2 mm Midsole width - forefoot 124.5 mm Midsole width - heel In the widest part of the heel, however, the Answer DMX turned out to be even wider than average. Our caliper reading showed 95.4 mm, over 4 mm wider than the average hoop shoe. This definitely contributes to the shoe's overall stability. Test results Answer DMX 95.4 mm Average 90.1 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 80.0 mm Midsole width - heel 105.1 mm Durability Toebox durability But what is the upside of getting an all-leather upper? Its insane resistance to abrasion, for sure! We chose our most dreaded weapon to test the durability of this Reebok shoe's toebox - the Dremel. Having drilled the toebox material for as long as 12 seconds at a 5K RPM speed, it seems like we only got through the topmost varnish! Your browser does not support the video tag. The Reebok Answer DMX got its well-deserved 5 out of 5 for toebox durability. Sneakerheads who blow away dust particles from their kicks need not worry about donning this Reebok shoe outside! Reebok Answer DMX vs. Adidas Harden Stepback 3 For reference, this is what mesh-upper hoop shoes come out like after the same Dremel test. Test results Answer DMX 5 Average 3.8 Compared to 64 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Toebox durability 5 Heel padding durability On the downside, the heel lining did not perform so well. Your browser does not support the video tag. After only 4 seconds, we saw the tool create a pretty bad tear on the heel collar material. This was quite surprising after seeing the abrasion resistance of the Reebok Blast's lining . So, it's not like the rand doesn't know how to make durable in-shoe linings. Unfortunately, we had to give this shoe's heel padding durability the lowest score - only 1 out of 5. This is less durable than the average across hoop shoes too. Test results Answer DMX 1 Average 3.6 Compared to 61 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1 Heel padding durability 5 Outsole hardness But before you become dismayed, let us show what the shoe's outsole looks like. It is incredibly hard! No, quite seriously, it is the hardest rubber in our basketball shoe roster so far! With a durometer measurement of 91.0 HC, it is firmer than 99% of our lab-tested shoes! It will surely take months before the outsole starts to show signs of wear. Test results Answer DMX 91.0 HC Average 81.5 HC We use an average of four tests. The photo shows one of those tests. Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 61.3 HC Outsole hardness 91.0 HC Outsole durability Which is 100% confirmed by our Dremel test! Applying the tool for 22 seconds at a pretty high speed of 10K RPM, we were shocked! You can see how the Dremel's cap just remains in the same place where it normally cuts through the rubber like a knife cuts through butter. Your browser does not support the video tag. And guess what? Our tread gauge shows that the damage is 0.3 mm. Zero. Point. Three. That's not even visible at arm's length! Test results Answer DMX 0.3 mm Average 1.1 mm Compared to 52 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Outsole wear 2.0 mm Outsole thickness And what's more, the Reebok Answer DMX uses a thicker-than-average rubber outsole too! Measuring it with our caliper, we got a reading of 4.5 mm. This shoe is guaranteed to last. Test results Answer DMX 4.5 mm Average 4.0 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 2.9 mm Outsole thickness 6.9 mm Misc Insole thickness Complementing the shoe's midsole is a well-padded insole. It shows 4.5 mm of thickness in our caliper, also average for a hoop shoe. Test results Answer DMX 4.5 mm Average 4.8 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 0.0 mm Insole thickness 8.6 mm Removable insole Using a custom insole or an orthotic won't be a problem with this Reebok shoe. Its insole is easily removable. Test results Answer DMX Yes Tongue padding Reebok loves them tongues thick. This is yet another hoop shoe with a generously padded tongue. Our caliper shows 12.5 mm which is 3 mm thicker than average! Paired with a well-padded collar, the Answer DMX offers a luxuriously comfortable in-shoe feel.

Test results Answer DMX 12.5 mm Average 9.2 mm Compared to 73 basketball shoes Number of shoes 1.3 mm Tongue padding 15.9 mm Tongue: gusset type The tongue is partially attached on the sides (semi-gusseted) which prevents it from sliding around just fine. Test results Answer DMX Both sides (semi) Heel tab There is no heel tab on the shoe but it has a wide enough mouth and a convenient lacing system to allow easy on-and-off action. Test results Answer DMX None Background The Answer DMX gives off a lot of retro vibes with its style inspired by the classic 90s release from the brand. It pays tribute to Allen Iverson, as seen on the Iverson branding/logos that prominently sit on the tongue, the sole, and the lateral side of the upper. Originally released in 1997, the silhouette made a comeback in 2018.
