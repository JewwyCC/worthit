    "text": "Cut in half: Nike LeBron 21 Review (2024) | RunRepeat Nike LeBron 21 review: LeBron shoes create a lot of hype in general, but the 21 is absolutely worth the energy. With Zoom Turbo in the forefoot, a shank in the midfoot, and Zoom Air in the heel, its cushioning system is spot on! We experienced a great mix of bounce and shock absorption, so playing in these hoopers was great fun. Despite being ready to jump, the 21 didn't feel unstable or wobbly, as its substantial structure made us surefooted in every single one of our game tests. Its high-quality materials definitely also made it a quite durable pair and helped us prevent ankle injuries. Just keep in mind that your feet will suffer throughout the long and harsh break-in period these LeBrons need. The shoe's skyrocketed price might hurt your wallet too, but it's definitely worth every penny!",

Cut 3 introducing it as the first-ever basketball shoe to use the cutting-edge ZoomX cushioning foam. This ultra-soft and responsive foam teamed up with the shoe's lightweight design to set our feet flying during the playtest! But as fun as that felt, we didn't think it was enough to justify the Cut 3's soaring price point. As a shoe that's meant for aggressive cuts, our primary concern was the lack of foot containment in the G.T. Cut 3. And we just couldn't let it slide.",

Its flexible and accommodating structure breaks with the past stiffer versions, providing smooth transitions and movements that require constant bending of the ball of the foot (like pretty much any kind of fake, for example). It features an IsoPlate and heavily padded interiors that add up to the tough upper material to offer wonderful foot lockdown and containment. Traction is yet another highlight of the Luka 3. It encouraged us to try more daring moves along with the shoe's supportive and stable structure. The only drawback here is that it feels like Jordan didn't try hard with this shoe even with its price, as it doesn't feature very high-quality materials or specific Nike technologies.",

    "text": "Nike LeBron 21 Performance Review last year's version was excellent this year's version is ever so slightly better welcome back to another Weare testers performance review my name is Allan and today we're taking a look at the LeBron 21 basketball shoes from Nike the changes are very incremental and it's not going to be radically better than last year's but as we all know incremental changes can have compounding effect in terms of performance and that is why I I like this better LeBron 21s now feature this leather upper material that is a contrast to the knit material that we had in last year's model last year's model was excellent in terms of lock down and foot containment but this leather upper material just adds a tiny bit extra rigidity and it feels just more substantial you do lose out on some breathability with the shoe as well as maybe a tiny bit of weight but overall I like the feeling of the leather in terms of foot containment when I was constantly Stu stopping and changing movements it really felt like it was cupping my feet really well and it felt comfortable while it did so there are perforations here on this side as well on this side but I think most of the breathability will really come from this tongue right here which we'll talk about later this type of upper material is also refreshing to see nowadays because most of the performance shoes that we get today are geared towards being as light as possible and having zero break in time so that usually means we get very thin uppers that can sometimes feel very cheap and plasticky on foot this just adds a nice premium feel to the shoe the technical weight of the shoe is heavier compared to last year's model but I really don't think it's going to make much of a difference even though the upper is thicker than last year's model it never felt like it dragged me down it still feels pretty minimal and light on foot overall there aren't any additional layers or paneling on top of it there aren't any plastic pieces so there are less factors for your feet to rub against other pieces that would otherwise cause discomfort underneath this leather upper material is actually still textile material so underneath this is a base layer you can actually see a peak of it through this swosh right here this textile material that is what's inside and on top of that are these cables that they call 360\u00b0 zonal cables you'll see the outlines of the lines here on this side as well as on the other side and then to finish it all off you have this leather exterior that we see on top of the shoe I've seen pictures of other future colorways that do not feature this leather type of material they have a glossy finish their uppers but nonetheless I still think that they will feel more substantial compared to the knit Upper from last year the laces now are thicker and they are rounded in his initial video Chris brought up the potential problem that these type of laces may have thick laces usually loosen up much easier and he was correct he's good In the Heat of battle he don't miss no when when I first played with these shoes I kind of lazily just tied my shoes I I don't think I double knotted to and it easily just loosened up so with these type of laces you have to double knot but the funny thing is when I did double knot these shoes the lace length was too short I just had the exact amount that's fine for most people but I think for people who have wide feet or people who wear ankle braces this can be a potential problem because those type of people usually need more lace length I myself like to wear ankle braces sometimes and when I did wear my ankle braces I needed more lace length if you run across that problem the only solution I can offer is that you have to skip one of the eyelets and the eyelet that I skipped is the second to the last one having this really thick and even more substantial lace lock is very fitting for the shoe just because the laces are thicker and Nike sphere is this cushioning system around the ankle and heel area they first introduced this in the Air Zoom generation and they reintroduced it in last year's model I'm really happy that they brought it back in the 21s just because it's just really comfortable it's nice and soft to the touch what's different for the Nike sphere is that it has these little cutouts and the idea in here is that the more that you play with this shoe the more moisture and heat will be applied and then the more that cushion will eventually mold to your feet but my favorite feature of it is that it's thick and it is very comfortable on my feet if you get the right size the Nike sphere cushion here as well as the tongue should really lock in your ankle the tongue can really make or break the fit of a shoe it's a very underrated part but it's such a large part of the shoe that covers the top of your foot this tongue is really the exact same tongue of the LeBron NXT I really like the tongue on the NXT version last year more than the LeBron 20s just because it was more bendable if the tongue is more bendable and if it is wide enough it really just hugs the ankle much better the LeBron 20 tongue was not so bad but it felt more rigid up top it was flatter than what I would have liked it to to be I just wanted it to just be a little B more malleable so it could fit around my ankle thankfully I didn't really experience any sort of heel slippage in last year's model some people did a really nice tongue could have helped as well but it's really a combination of the tongue and the heel and Ankle cushion that will really give you a nice hugging feel as long as you get the right size the heel counter in last year's model was already pretty solid but it wasn't listed on the text sheet whether it had a heel clip what did have a heel clip is the NXT version the heel clip in the 21s is even beefier and it does cover a larger area in the heel part that is always welcome and that should help you out in terms of heel lock down when your foot is inside the shoe these act as Tiny sidewalls uh they're not that high but just being there helps they work with the leather upper to help contain your foot in the footed as for the torsional support of the shoe the LeBron 21 Now features the plastic rectangular piece instead of a beefier carbon fiber shank plate it does have a little bit more 4ft Flex compared to last year's model but in terms of rigidity in the middle it's still also pretty hard to bend the TPU shank plate is there more for rigidity rather than being more of propulsion type of plate last year's model had a carbon fiber shank plate and that one was really hard to bend even in the for area so this is one of the bigger differences between this shoe and last year's model do you want something that has more Flex or do you want something that is just rigid throughout and that's going to depend on your foot type and preference I usually like shoes that have more for foot flex it allows me to use uh less part of the out soole namely the 4 foot and that allows me to touch off of the ground much easier if I were playing with a shoe that was torsionally rigid throughout it forces me to use more of the shoe since I can't Flex it as much so my reaction time would be fractionally slower just having that TPU shank plate I think is just enough for the shoe to not overfolded shoe is the best part about it Landings were really nice and it felt good in terms of impact protection I never felt like my feet hurt at any point when I was playing so that's always good when you have that type of cushion and really good traction uh that just makes playing really really fun cushion construction is similar to last year's model but only really different is the mids Soul carrier foam last year had kushlan and this year you have kushlan 2.0 from a first Tryon perspective it does feel stiffer after playing more and more with it it felt broken in and a bit softer and bouncier as well when I played with last year's model the cushion in that shoe eventually felt really good but there was a painful breaking period for myself with this year's model I didn't feel any sort of pain or whatsoever so I would attribute that to the less aggressive TPU shank plate like I said earlier maybe the kushon 2.0 foam also help in that regard I would say that the 4 foot part of the LeBron 21's is slightly closer to the ground but again really not by much there is a 6 mm Zoom bag up front what's notable about being a broad and articulated Zoom bag is that it feels more seamless when you have a zoom bag that is small and doesn't have folds on it it will feel more noticeable what I like about the zoom bag here is that it is bouncy but it doesn't poke my feet or anything like that I would imagine that that's what most people want to you don't want it to be reminding you that there's Tech here or Tech here in the heel part of the shoe you have a zoom bag too that is stock fitted into the kushlan foam when your foot lands in the heel part of the shoe you will hit the kushon part first before the zoom back so that sort of dissipates the force that you put into it and it gives you greater impact protection some people had problems with the heel stability last year in this year's model the kushon 2.0 foam is a stiffer hopefully the heel cushion part here will give you enough stiffness so that you won't feel any sort of instability there you have a little bit of an out rigor that Jets out a bit and it's not very pronounced but it's good that it's there just like last year's model traction performance for me was excellent this particular colorway has this translucent out soole it worked really well I played with it and a clean court and a dirty Court even played with it briefly outdoors and it grip pretty well traction pattern is pretty much identical to last year's model it's just a different storytelling touch to it this one is a call out to the oyster SL clamshell theme of the shoe there are going to be future colorways that have solid outsoles you have the outsole extending on the medial side which I'm always a fan of like most performance basketball shoes nowadays this is best for indoors but not everyone plays indoors so at least the traction pattern is consistent all throughout and it should freay out evenly what size should you get so so for context my foot profile is that my right foot is wider than my left foot that's why I went up half a size for my true size I also like to wear ankle braces every now and then so if you are a wide footer or you wear ankle braces just like I do I would recommend you going up at least half a size if you want a One to One fit go through the size it will give you a snug fit in the midfoot and your toes will almost touch the top part of the shoe the toe box was pretty comfortable for me I didn't feel like it was too narrow but midfoot area does feel more narrow compared to last year's model but I would also attribute that to the upper material of the shoe this upper is leather compared to the knit Upper from last year so it will break in but it won't break in as much as last year's model if you played in last year's model and that size worked out well for you just go with the same size with this model that is about it for my performance review of the LeBron 21 basketball shoes these really enhance what was really good with the LeBron 20s and the NXT versions from last year this will be a favorite among a lot of people with different play Styles as always hopefully you'll wear your shoes out there play basketball have fun my name is Allan and I'll see you again on the next performance review peace Pros: this year",

    "text": "LeBron 21 Performance Test - Shoe of the YEAR? for the past 21 years we've been blessed with LeBron's abilities on and off the court a lot of people in the world consider LeBron the greatest player of all time and for the greatest you can't just have a normal shoe last year the LeBron 20 was arguably the best shoe of the year will the 21 replace the 20 let's find out if you like the LeBron 20 then by default you will probably like the LeBron 21 as well as a lot of these qualities remain the same now however that will come down to preference when it's all said and done hey it's going to be up to you jerk but let's talk about the details first now the cushion setup is pretty much identical to the 20 Zoom turbo unit in the 4ot a kushon mid Sole and then a bigger Zoom Air unit in the back now what you will feel here is a nice balance of court feeli and impact protection the zoom turbo is just enough to make you feel springy when necessary when you making your moves and you got to hit you a little hesy it's going to activate when you need it to but it's also subtle and real comfortable at the same time but then on the flip side to that when you do really need to get off the ground and you need to snag that board hey you got that Zoom Air in the back for impact protection as well now the traction was another area pretty much identical to the 20 but an area that I enjoyed nonetheless a multi-directional traction pattern that held its own every time I played hey you ain't got to take it from me peep the peep the traction test for the [Applause] result [Applause] squeaky squeaky come on jerks you ain't going nowhere in these but hey every cour is different y'all know what I say just be sure that you're wiping and taking care of yourself and you should be good now I wouldn't recommend going outside as the rubber may break down a little faster than you may want it to but hey again as long as you staying inside you should be straight now the materials the upper to be exact is the main difference between the 20 and the 21 in my opinion the LeBron 20 has this knit upper whereas the 21 has this velvet like soft synthetic like I like type of uper I ain't going to lie I was digging it I was digging it for sure but then underneath the Velva you have this underlaying Flywire cabling system that's supposed to bring you together and hold you in place at the same time hey I like what Nike pulled here get it Fly wire pull so it kind of gives off that suede high quality look to it now I got to be honest is is it as functional as N I don't know maybe not as functional but you can still do what you need to do now that's not to say it's stiff or you will be hindered on the court or or anything like that you can still do what you need to do and I'm going to be honest if we talking $200 a high quality me go ahead and put a little suede a little extra on top of mine that's that's just me though I I don't mind it either way again it's just going to come down to your preference do you want to go more premium give you that premium look that premium fi at premium finish on the 21 or you want the knit upper where it may be a little more ventilated than something like this so it might be a little more functional it's up to you I don't mind it either way now the fit and lock down is another area that I really enjoyed right when you put them on you get a nice snug one to one fit and that's mainly found due to the sizing the LeBron 21 runs true the size jerk you going to know right away so if you wear that 10 hell yeah just get that 10 jerk also was mentioned earlier that cabling system with the fly wire will help with overall containment and you have a TPU shank midfoot for added stability overall just consider this sneaker the LeBron 20 Elite that's all you got to do in my opin don't even overthink it it's just the LeBron 20 Elite y'all remember back in the day when you had the Kobe then you had the Kobe 8 Elite same concept we just talked about this not too long ago actually jerks hey that's all they did same concept this just the LeBron 20 Elite eat that's all all they came with is just an upper switch and then some fly wire on the inside but hey if I'm if I'm being honest it's some some pretty nice touches if I may say if I may say so myself like I don't mind it don't get it twisted if I got a if I got a slide on one I still might slide in my 20s on you I don't I don't know it's just something about the 20 man to for me the 20 is one of the one of my favorite shoes of all time I've been trying to put it out there I love the LeBron 20 bro it gives me mad Kobe Bobs but like a newer version that 20 different and it's been holding up I know a lot of people go away from flying it because it breaks down over time but you know it kind of comes apart but I don't feel like you get that issue as much on the 20 but if you do and that's been happening to you then that was the fix for the 21 you feel me of the three the 20 the NXT the 21 is simply going to come down to preference and design choice I mean which one do you like the most yo the 21 is going to give you that premium feel with a nice balance of performance that's real solid jerk the 20 is mainly performance and has a lower cut for those who like to play in sneakers like this one the Kobe and Etc hey if you find yourself in that category you can still rock out with the 20 then you have the NXT which is probably the most durable option and probably the most affordable at the same time if you like the LeBron line and you trying to take a pair of bronze outside hey you hoop outside a lot I think you got to go NXT it's just my opinion but that's it for me man thank you guys for being here I hope this kind of helps you decide which pair of bronze you may want to rock with again there's no wrong choice in my opinion it's just going to come down to preference if you want that quality then go quality uh because that suede is going to look kind of crazy on court I ain't going to lie like I even wear these all court and uh yeah them them look crazy whereas these I don't think you can just get away with rocking these off court but with some joggers or something you roll them up hey I was rocking these you feel me I did like a little baggie you know what I'm saying I had this hoodie on just did like a little baggy little bronze shoot I left a couple bronze out like I got the Jades and you know I left the South Beaches and a couple of more pairs out but hey you know what I'm saying lock in with me on the gram again at imj Jones follow your boy show me some love why cuz I can't get brand deals without you there I said it but thank you guys for showing love to the content be sure to watch everything that I'm doing I know sometimes I come with sneaker vids and then I come with food vids and you know I might drop I might drop a rap app who knows but this just me bro just like me for me if you a jerk just support another jerk that's all that's all but yeah man know that I appreciate you and I see you jerks on the next one peace oh you kind of far you know I don't give Dam on the night I was born the rain was pouring God was crying lightning struck power out his Sparks was flying solid Trac you can hit a squeak ain't that what y'all do now ain't going nowhere squeak huh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] squeak

    "text": "Nike LeBron 21 Performance Review last year's version was excellent this year's version is ever so slightly better welcome back to another Weare testers performance review my name is Allan and today we're taking a look at the LeBron 21 basketball shoes from Nike the changes are very incremental and it's not going to be radically better than last year's but as we all know incremental changes can have compounding effect in terms of performance and that is why I I like this better LeBron 21s now feature this leather upper material that is a contrast to the knit material that we had in last year's model last year's model was excellent in terms of lock down and foot containment but this leather upper material just adds a tiny bit extra rigidity and it feels just more substantial you do lose out on some breathability with the shoe as well as maybe a tiny bit of weight but overall I like the feeling of the leather in terms of foot containment when I was constantly Stu stopping and changing movements it really felt like it was cupping my feet really well and it felt comfortable while it did so there are perforations here on this side as well on this side but I think most of the breathability will really come from this tongue right here which we'll talk about later this type of upper material is also refreshing to see nowadays because most of the performance shoes that we get today are geared towards being as light as possible and having zero break in time so that usually means we get very thin uppers that can sometimes feel very cheap and plasticky on foot this just adds a nice premium feel to the shoe the technical weight of the shoe is heavier compared to last year's model but I really don't think it's going to make much of a difference even though the upper is thicker than last year's model it never felt like it dragged me down it still feels pretty minimal and light on foot overall there aren't any additional layers or paneling on top of it there aren't any plastic pieces so there are less factors for your feet to rub against other pieces that would otherwise cause discomfort underneath this leather upper material is actually still textile material so underneath this is a base layer you can actually see a peak of it through this swosh right here this textile material that is what's inside and on top of that are these cables that they call 360\u00b0 zonal cables you'll see the outlines of the lines here on this side as well as on the other side and then to finish it all off you have this leather exterior that we see on top of the shoe I've seen pictures of other future colorways that do not feature this leather type of material they have a glossy finish their uppers but nonetheless I still think that they will feel more substantial compared to the knit Upper from last year the laces now are thicker and they are rounded in his initial video Chris brought up the potential problem that these type of laces may have thick laces usually loosen up much easier and he was correct he's good In the Heat of battle he don't miss no when when I first played with these shoes I kind of lazily just tied my shoes I I don't think I double knotted to and it easily just loosened up so with these type of laces you have to double knot but the funny thing is when I did double knot these shoes the lace length was too short I just had the exact amount that's fine for most people but I think for people who have wide feet or people who wear ankle braces this can be a potential problem because those type of people usually need more lace length I myself like to wear ankle braces sometimes and when I did wear my ankle braces I needed more lace length if you run across that problem the only solution I can offer is that you have to skip one of the eyelets and the eyelet that I skipped is the second to the last one having this really thick and even more substantial lace lock is very fitting for the shoe just because the laces are thicker and Nike sphere is this cushioning system around the ankle and heel area they first introduced this in the Air Zoom generation and they reintroduced it in last year's model I'm really happy that they brought it back in the 21s just because it's just really comfortable it's nice and soft to the touch what's different for the Nike sphere is that it has these little cutouts and the idea in here is that the more that you play with this shoe the more moisture and heat will be applied and then the more that cushion will eventually mold to your feet but my favorite feature of it is that it's thick and it is very comfortable on my feet if you get the right size the Nike sphere cushion here as well as the tongue should really lock in your ankle the tongue can really make or break the fit of a shoe it's a very underrated part but it's such a large part of the shoe that covers the top of your foot this tongue is really the exact same tongue of the LeBron NXT I really like the tongue on the NXT version last year more than the LeBron 20s just because it was more bendable if the tongue is more bendable and if it is wide enough it really just hugs the ankle much better the LeBron 20 tongue was not so bad but it felt more rigid up top it was flatter than what I would have liked it to to be I just wanted it to just be a little B more malleable so it could fit around my ankle thankfully I didn't really experience any sort of heel slippage in last year's model some people did a really nice tongue could have helped as well but it's really a combination of the tongue and the heel and Ankle cushion that will really give you a nice hugging feel as long as you get the right size the heel counter in last year's model was already pretty solid but it wasn't listed on the text sheet whether it had a heel clip what did have a heel clip is the NXT version the heel clip in the 21s is even beefier and it does cover a larger area in the heel part that is always welcome and that should help you out in terms of heel lock down when your foot is inside the shoe these act as Tiny sidewalls uh they're not that high but just being there helps they work with the leather upper to help contain your foot in the footed as for the torsional support of the shoe the LeBron 21 Now features the plastic rectangular piece instead of a beefier carbon fiber shank plate it does have a little bit more 4ft Flex compared to last year's model but in terms of rigidity in the middle it's still also pretty hard to bend the TPU shank plate is there more for rigidity rather than being more of propulsion type of plate last year's model had a carbon fiber shank plate and that one was really hard to bend even in the for area so this is one of the bigger differences between this shoe and last year's model do you want something that has more Flex or do you want something that is just rigid throughout and that's going to depend on your foot type and preference I usually like shoes that have more for foot flex it allows me to use uh less part of the out soole namely the 4 foot and that allows me to touch off of the ground much easier if I were playing with a shoe that was torsionally rigid throughout it forces me to use more of the shoe since I can't Flex it as much so my reaction time would be fractionally slower just having that TPU shank plate I think is just enough for the shoe to not overfolded shoe is the best part about it Landings were really nice and it felt good in terms of impact protection I never felt like my feet hurt at any point when I was playing so that's always good when you have that type of cushion and really good traction uh that just makes playing really really fun cushion construction is similar to last year's model but only really different is the mids Soul carrier foam last year had kushlan and this year you have kushlan 2.0 from a first Tryon perspective it does feel stiffer after playing more and more with it it felt broken in and a bit softer and bouncier as well when I played with last year's model the cushion in that shoe eventually felt really good but there was a painful breaking period for myself with this year's model I didn't feel any sort of pain or whatsoever so I would attribute that to the less aggressive TPU shank plate like I said earlier maybe the kushon 2.0 foam also help in that regard I would say that the 4 foot part of the LeBron 21's is slightly closer to the ground but again really not by much there is a 6 mm Zoom bag up front what's notable about being a broad and articulated Zoom bag is that it feels more seamless when you have a zoom bag that is small and doesn't have folds on it it will feel more noticeable what I like about the zoom bag here is that it is bouncy but it doesn't poke my feet or anything like that I would imagine that that's what most people want to you don't want it to be reminding you that there's Tech here or Tech here in the heel part of the shoe you have a zoom bag too that is stock fitted into the kushlan foam when your foot lands in the heel part of the shoe you will hit the kushon part first before the zoom back so that sort of dissipates the force that you put into it and it gives you greater impact protection some people had problems with the heel stability last year in this year's model the kushon 2.0 foam is a stiffer hopefully the heel cushion part here will give you enough stiffness so that you won't feel any sort of instability there you have a little bit of an out rigor that Jets out a bit and it's not very pronounced but it's good that it's there just like last year's model traction performance for me was excellent this particular colorway has this translucent out soole it worked really well I played with it and a clean court and a dirty Court even played with it briefly outdoors and it grip pretty well traction pattern is pretty much identical to last year's model it's just a different storytelling touch to it this one is a call out to the oyster SL clamshell theme of the shoe there are going to be future colorways that have solid outsoles you have the outsole extending on the medial side which I'm always a fan of like most performance basketball shoes nowadays this is best for indoors but not everyone plays indoors so at least the traction pattern is consistent all throughout and it should freay out evenly what size should you get so so for context my foot profile is that my right foot is wider than my left foot that's why I went up half a size for my true size I also like to wear ankle braces every now and then so if you are a wide footer or you wear ankle braces just like I do I would recommend you going up at least half a size if you want a One to One fit go through the size it will give you a snug fit in the midfoot and your toes will almost touch the top part of the shoe the toe box was pretty comfortable for me I didn't feel like it was too narrow but midfoot area does feel more narrow compared to last year's model but I would also attribute that to the upper material of the shoe this upper is leather compared to the knit Upper from last year so it will break in but it won't break in as much as last year's model if you played in last year's model and that size worked out well for you just go with the same size with this model that is about it for my performance review of the LeBron 21 basketball shoes these really enhance what was really good with the LeBron 20s and the NXT versions from last year this will be a favorite among a lot of people with different play Styles as always hopefully you'll wear your shoes out there play basketball have fun my name is Allan and I'll see you again on the next performance review peace Pros: this year",

    "text": "Nike GT Cut 3 Performance Review I know that we're late I apologize but here's the performance review on the GT cut [Music] [Music] 3s yeah I always hey what's up guys my name is Chris welcome back to the official wear testers.com YouTube channel today we got the performance review of the Nike GT cut 3 this is part of their greater than series with what GT means so that's why you see the different varieties and stuff the jump the hustle and the cut and I will say that this shoe right here despite being extremely overpriced is fantastic so first things first the outsole right here is very simple it's damn near Herring bone it's just kind of enlarged and it just worked really well it worked on every CT that I took them on I needed to do minimal wiping if I happen to have an issue a wipe was all they needed and then boom it was squeaking like crazy and no I wouldn't take these outside especially for the price uh even if I got them on discount I doubt that I would do that either just because the rubber is very soft it's very tacky it's almost gummy and it's just one of those things where if you take them Outdoors uh they're going to get a obliterated fairly quickly this is where the academy comes into play which is the lower price offering and I think that that shoe is just more suitable for like most of everything else this is really supposed to be their indoor shoe like their main indoor shoe if if the Hyperdunk back in the day was Nike's Flagship model that's the way that they used to describe it that's exactly what I would describe these as this is Nike's current Flagship model like if Nike were a signature shoe in and of itself this would be it so yeah I just really love the traction it didn't really give me any problems whatsoever this is almost a perfect shoe in my opinion at least compared to stuff that Nike's put out recently and yeah it gives you a lot of everything despite the really expensive retail price now as far as the cushion is concerned these guys right here don't have any Zoom Air in them whatsoever like the previous two models however I don't think that that's a big deal I would love it if they did have Zoom Air but I do think that they might be a little bit more unstable if they did instead what we have is zoomx foam and that's actually housed within the Eva carrier or whatever so like the midsole that you see is is a denser or more stable foam and then inside there's a full-on footed or slab of zoomx foam it's stupid bouncy dude like it's mad comfortable I really like it like the way that these feel from the day that I pulled them out of the box to still right now they feel almost the same like they're just that comfortable now are there any instability issues with the cushion I would say no but on certain really really harsh movements sometimes I think this is the rubber but sometimes you could feel like the the midsole or whatever this 4ot area get sucked underneath your foot it's not anything to where like I'm going to roll over or anything like that it's just something I can feel you can kind of feel the bounce when you plant hopefully we were able to capture that in the b-roll I apologize for the lack of b-roll when we walked in the gym that day it was empty so there was nobody to play with it was just me doesn't anyone love me so we did what we could but hopefully it's good enough to kind of like show what it is I'm talking about now luckily this 4ft area did have that rubber like wrapped up so even with that kind of like bounce or that little like I guess you would call it like a wobble or whatever it was able to catch it and then I was able to still move and do whatever it is that I needed to do so there wasn't like a big issue there whatsoever I will say that there is two issues that I had with the shoe one of which I'll talk about in a little bit the first one though is the insole for whatever reason that thing just doesn't want to break in and so it like chews up the pads of my toes especially my big one and that sucks ass like it's one of those things where it's like can you please please break it and it just won't especially that one and they're glued in there by the way so I can't even pull it out anymore cuz I was testing them like stock as they come which was what we normally do and yeah now they're just like super adhered there yes I could do the hairdyer trick do I feel like it one of the things that I love about them is just the overall like sculpting of the midsole the tooling the cushioning all that stuff it just really works really well together like in tandem the back here is very reminiscent of their modern running shoes as far as Nike is concerned and that's exactly the way that they feel they really roll you into your forefoot and into your stride and it's just fantastic the materials are the other thing that like I would say are not like great I do like the micro fiber that's here in the center the shell material that they use that's kind of like a little bit stiffer is okay I just wish that there were some Flex Points it was like right here at the uh like the base of the lace like those first or or last two depending on which way you want to start those were the areas where they felt like they would bow or Flex away from my foot a little bit and I don't like the way that that feels so after some playing time I would always have to readjust my laces and I'm talking about like every session so that was the only thing that I found to be slightly irritating but other than that no real issues with the material they're not my favorite thing whatsoever but do they work yes they do they're also extremely light so if you wanted to see what these guys weighed right here there you go well I suppose that's not super light but it's very light in hand and on foot the overall fit I'd go true to size I think that that works best that's what I did and they feel amazing And as far as support is concerned again that was one of those things that I felt like is good you know what I mean like I don't know why I keep hearing and reading that like oh these lact torsion supports like no bro do you see this plate right here it extends into the 4 foot that thing does a few different things one it's a spring plate so that whole rolling into your stride thing and really snapping or propelling you forward it does that on top of that try twisting this you can't this is one stiff shoe despite how light they are despite how bouncy they are it's extremely supportive so I don't know why that's even a concern I'm not sure if people that are complaining about it exactly know what they're talking about but either way this right here is solid like this is more support than we've gotten from any Kyrie from Nike ever and more support that we've gotten from the current book line so yeah the one area of support that could be upgraded is the heel the heel counter could be a little bit more rigid but other than that like really not a big issue so the overall fit the stability like the width of the shoe and stuff like that the way that everything is sculpted it all works and tan together and it just is a funing ride man like if you have not played in these and maybe the price is the thing to tearing you first off I understand completely second wait until they're within range and then try them out you might just like these so with that being said though uh what is is today's question of the day would you prefer to review action figures or sneakers oh so feel free to go back in time and explain how you got here what do you mean a long long time ago every nook and cranny in our two-bedroom apartment was full of shoes and action figures and your wife said ones got to go out with the toys uh yeah that's not how we got here though I know but I'm just saying it's part of how we got here there was never once when I decided to pick up a camera for whatever strange reason that the reason why I wanted to pick up a camera was to talk about toys no I know okay so let's just put that out there right now so let's just say that I'm deeply in love with Footwear and the way that it performs and all that stuff so that's what obviously I chose to talk about when I did pick up that camera and so that's what I really love talking about still to this day but would I like to review toys uh I don't know cuz a review to me is full of lots of stuff you know what I mean like it's full of tons of information historical information or at least halfway accurate information things that you just didn't know and I feel like the people that do toy reviews do that stuff really really well as far as like reviewing a product that's the thing like a toy to me is a toy you know what I mean like this is equipment when I buy this like for one it's way more expensive than a figure at least the figures that I buy I know that there's like hot toys and stuff like that that are believe it or not more expensive than any shoe on the shelf right now but yeah I just I'm not like that critical of of toys like what would I talk about like hey here's Wolverine for the billionth time hey it's a big island bum so yeah so it's just one of those things where I would love to make toy videos just how would I do it I don't know I can tell you right now that it wouldn't be critical whatsoever it would just be look at how awesome this thing is and man I wish that we had stuff like this when I was a kid that's how I look at toys did you want a [Music] BTS so yeah excuse the mess but um this is just some of the stuff I I like this stuff man I think this is awesome this is a mixture of retro and Originals this is all retro right here those are Originals those are fantastic those are also originals and those are also Originals this is a mix of retro and original and then we've got all of this stuff too so uh these are the new ones but then those are the old ones these are what I had as a kid these are just these are amazing but yeah I would like to make videos on stuff like that but I don't know or I don't feel confident that I would would do it any better than anybody else that does it but with that being said I hope that you guys found the performance review wow that's actually a really weird thing I just a lot of basketball players are going to see all my action figures and be like dude you're a lame like what a dork no or they're going to be like maybe do you like to play with toys and get Buckets what did we just become best friends yep anyways that's performance review hopefully I'm not too embarrassed but we'll see in the comment section pretty soon and uh if you guys wanted to have a question question of the day or participate in it feel free to leave them down below in the comment section we would love to choose one if we don't get to it and you think that it's a great one make sure that you keep leaving it we'll find it eventually and and we'll post it and stuff and I'll answer your guys' question they could be pretty much anything they could be random they could be cool behind the scenes stuff like this or personal stuff whatever it is that you want to

    "text": "Nike GT Cut 3 Performance Review I know that we're late I apologize but here's the performance review on the GT cut [Music] [Music] 3s yeah I always hey what's up guys my name is Chris welcome back to the official wear testers.com YouTube channel today we got the performance review of the Nike GT cut 3 this is part of their greater than series with what GT means so that's why you see the different varieties and stuff the jump the hustle and the cut and I will say that this shoe right here despite being extremely overpriced is fantastic so first things first the outsole right here is very simple it's damn near Herring bone it's just kind of enlarged and it just worked really well it worked on every CT that I took them on I needed to do minimal wiping if I happen to have an issue a wipe was all they needed and then boom it was squeaking like crazy and no I wouldn't take these outside especially for the price uh even if I got them on discount I doubt that I would do that either just because the rubber is very soft it's very tacky it's almost gummy and it's just one of those things where if you take them Outdoors uh they're going to get a obliterated fairly quickly this is where the academy comes into play which is the lower price offering and I think that that shoe is just more suitable for like most of everything else this is really supposed to be their indoor shoe like their main indoor shoe if if the Hyperdunk back in the day was Nike's Flagship model that's the way that they used to describe it that's exactly what I would describe these as this is Nike's current Flagship model like if Nike were a signature shoe in and of itself this would be it so yeah I just really love the traction it didn't really give me any problems whatsoever this is almost a perfect shoe in my opinion at least compared to stuff that Nike's put out recently and yeah it gives you a lot of everything despite the really expensive retail price now as far as the cushion is concerned these guys right here don't have any Zoom Air in them whatsoever like the previous two models however I don't think that that's a big deal I would love it if they did have Zoom Air but I do think that they might be a little bit more unstable if they did instead what we have is zoomx foam and that's actually housed within the Eva carrier or whatever so like the midsole that you see is is a denser or more stable foam and then inside there's a full-on footed or slab of zoomx foam it's stupid bouncy dude like it's mad comfortable I really like it like the way that these feel from the day that I pulled them out of the box to still right now they feel almost the same like they're just that comfortable now are there any instability issues with the cushion I would say no but on certain really really harsh movements sometimes I think this is the rubber but sometimes you could feel like the the midsole or whatever this 4ot area get sucked underneath your foot it's not anything to where like I'm going to roll over or anything like that it's just something I can feel you can kind of feel the bounce when you plant hopefully we were able to capture that in the b-roll I apologize for the lack of b-roll when we walked in the gym that day it was empty so there was nobody to play with it was just me doesn't anyone love me so we did what we could but hopefully it's good enough to kind of like show what it is I'm talking about now luckily this 4ft area did have that rubber like wrapped up so even with that kind of like bounce or that little like I guess you would call it like a wobble or whatever it was able to catch it and then I was able to still move and do whatever it is that I needed to do so there wasn't like a big issue there whatsoever I will say that there is two issues that I had with the shoe one of which I'll talk about in a little bit the first one though is the insole for whatever reason that thing just doesn't want to break in and so it like chews up the pads of my toes especially my big one and that sucks ass like it's one of those things where it's like can you please please break it and it just won't especially that one and they're glued in there by the way so I can't even pull it out anymore cuz I was testing them like stock as they come which was what we normally do and yeah now they're just like super adhered there yes I could do the hairdyer trick do I feel like it one of the things that I love about them is just the overall like sculpting of the midsole the tooling the cushioning all that stuff it just really works really well together like in tandem the back here is very reminiscent of their modern running shoes as far as Nike is concerned and that's exactly the way that they feel they really roll you into your forefoot and into your stride and it's just fantastic the materials are the other thing that like I would say are not like great I do like the micro fiber that's here in the center the shell material that they use that's kind of like a little bit stiffer is okay I just wish that there were some Flex Points it was like right here at the uh like the base of the lace like those first or or last two depending on which way you want to start those were the areas where they felt like they would bow or Flex away from my foot a little bit and I don't like the way that that feels so after some playing time I would always have to readjust my laces and I'm talking about like every session so that was the only thing that I found to be slightly irritating but other than that no real issues with the material they're not my favorite thing whatsoever but do they work yes they do they're also extremely light so if you wanted to see what these guys weighed right here there you go well I suppose that's not super light but it's very light in hand and on foot the overall fit I'd go true to size I think that that works best that's what I did and they feel amazing And as far as support is concerned again that was one of those things that I felt like is good you know what I mean like I don't know why I keep hearing and reading that like oh these lact torsion supports like no bro do you see this plate right here it extends into the 4 foot that thing does a few different things one it's a spring plate so that whole rolling into your stride thing and really snapping or propelling you forward it does that on top of that try twisting this you can't this is one stiff shoe despite how light they are despite how bouncy they are it's extremely supportive so I don't know why that's even a concern I'm not sure if people that are complaining about it exactly know what they're talking about but either way this right here is solid like this is more support than we've gotten from any Kyrie from Nike ever and more support that we've gotten from the current book line so yeah the one area of support that could be upgraded is the heel the heel counter could be a little bit more rigid but other than that like really not a big issue so the overall fit the stability like the width of the shoe and stuff like that the way that everything is sculpted it all works and tan together and it just is a funing ride man like if you have not played in these and maybe the price is the thing to tearing you first off I understand completely second wait until they're within range and then try them out you might just like these so with that being said though uh what is is today's question of the day would you prefer to review action figures or sneakers oh so feel free to go back in time and explain how you got here what do you mean a long long time ago every nook and cranny in our two-bedroom apartment was full of shoes and action figures and your wife said ones got to go out with the toys uh yeah that's not how we got here though I know but I'm just saying it's part of how we got here there was never once when I decided to pick up a camera for whatever strange reason that the reason why I wanted to pick up a camera was to talk about toys no I know okay so let's just put that out there right now so let's just say that I'm deeply in love with Footwear and the way that it performs and all that stuff so that's what obviously I chose to talk about when I did pick up that camera and so that's what I really love talking about still to this day but would I like to review toys uh I don't know cuz a review to me is full of lots of stuff you know what I mean like it's full of tons of information historical information or at least halfway accurate information things that you just didn't know and I feel like the people that do toy reviews do that stuff really really well as far as like reviewing a product that's the thing like a toy to me is a toy you know what I mean like this is equipment when I buy this like for one it's way more expensive than a figure at least the figures that I buy I know that there's like hot toys and stuff like that that are believe it or not more expensive than any shoe on the shelf right now but yeah I just I'm not like that critical of of toys like what would I talk about like hey here's Wolverine for the billionth time hey it's a big island bum so yeah so it's just one of those things where I would love to make toy videos just how would I do it I don't know I can tell you right now that it wouldn't be critical whatsoever it would just be look at how awesome this thing is and man I wish that we had stuff like this when I was a kid that's how I look at toys did you want a [Music] BTS so yeah excuse the mess but um this is just some of

    "text": "Cut in half: Nike LeBron 21 Review (2024) | RunRepeat Nike LeBron 21 review: LeBron shoes create a lot of hype in general, but the 21 is absolutely worth the energy. With Zoom Turbo in the forefoot, a shank in the midfoot, and Zoom Air in the heel, its cushioning system is spot on! We experienced a great mix of bounce and shock absorption, so playing in these hoopers was great fun. Despite being ready to jump, the 21 didn't feel unstable or wobbly, as its substantial structure made us surefooted in every single one of our game tests. Its high-quality materials definitely also made it a quite durable pair and helped us prevent ankle injuries. Just keep in mind that your feet will suffer throughout the long and harsh break-in period these LeBrons need. The shoe's skyrocketed price might hurt your wallet too, but it's definitely worth every penny!",

Cut 3 introducing it as the first-ever basketball shoe to use the cutting-edge ZoomX cushioning foam. This ultra-soft and responsive foam teamed up with the shoe's lightweight design to set our feet flying during the playtest! But as fun as that felt, we didn't think it was enough to justify the Cut 3's soaring price point. As a shoe that's meant for aggressive cuts, our primary concern was the lack of foot containment in the G.T. Cut 3. And we just couldn't let it slide.",

Not because I want to play pro anymore but just because I missed it. \n\nI knew if I could get back to dunking consistently, that would be a good metric to say I was close to my old self athletically and I\u2019m happy to say mission accomplished \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd still need a few more inches to really be happy but\u2026the proof is in the progress.\n\nAlong with a lotttt of working out, I wanted to find the best shoe possible for my explosive play style both on offense and defense. \n\nMy all time favorite shoe is the Jordan 28 but since I can\u2019t find that anywhere in my size for a reasonable price, I went on the hunt. \n\nI tested the Nike LeBron 21 (before the 22s dropped and I don\u2019t want those either), Adidas AE1 Low, WOW All City 12 Encore, Nike GT Cut 3, Rigorer AR 2 and WOW 10 Low. You can see most of these on my feet in the video but below are my brief reviews in order from worst to best in my opinion. \n\nLebron 21 - LeBron\u2019s always cause my feet to cramp\u2026always have and apparently always will. I felt bouncy in them but never really agile. But once the pain set in I felt\u2026like taking them off. So I did and returned them. I\u2019m sure they might break in or whatever but I\u2019m good. \n\nGT Cut 3 - giving these away. The foams is nice\u2026don\u2019t enjoy it too much or you might hurt yourself because nothing else is\u2026that\u2019s it the end. \n\nWOW All City 12 Encore - these disappointed me and almost made me not try wow again (glad I did). Not because they were terrible but because they didn\u2019t feel special. I\u2019m giving these away also though because that GCU outsole is just toooooo sticky. Side to side Stopping was hazardous to my health. The one hand off the backboard dunk in the video is in these though. Definitely bouncy but you don\u2019t really feel it. If it wasn\u2019t for the ultra grip, I\u2019d probably keep these in rotation. \n\nAE 1 Low - I love these\u2026but my pinky toes goes numb and then it spreads and I can\u2019t do it. Most of the dunks in the video are in these. They are bouncy and quick but they run SMALLLLL. I checked the cm measurements because people were saying the wow 10s ran small and I figured, let me compare them. These run considerably smaller and that explains my numb foot. Unfortunately, I wear a 13 and 13.5 is very hard to come by so these while amazing if you can get the fit right, are also being given away to a high school kid in need. \n\nRigorer AR 2 - my surprise runner up. Austin Reeves is my guy, I\u2019m a Laker guy and so I had to give these a try and I\u2019m very happy that I did. The traction is Perfect and the rest of the package just works so well together. It\u2019s not the bounciest or softest foam but whatever middle ground they found is\u2026nice. I really enjoy these and I\u2019m keeping them likely for outdoor. Definitely some of the best bang for your buck for $100 (120+ with shipping)\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 WOW 10 Low - Man listen\u2026I read so many reviews and watched so many videos of everyone saying how great these are. From the moment I put my foot in them and stood up I was like yup\u2026these are them \ud83d\ude02 to make sure, I took them to the gym first thing in the morning and went through a workout. The last dunk is in these and that gym has notoriously high rims with a floor that gives you nothing. That was one of the cleanest easiest dunks I\u2019ve been able to do in there and I\u2019m coming off of a little knee sprain. I get what all the fuss is about and I\u2019m ordering another pair today just in case something happens and they try to make us buy the dolphin 11s (can\u2019t do it). They are bouncy, running is much\u2026easier, they are bouncy, the shoe hugs you perfectly it\u2019s just, the best shoe I\u2019ve put on my feet for basketball in a while and I knew almost immediately. Go get a pair if they are in your budget. Just get a pair \ud83d\ude02\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted talk, hope it helps someone like you all helped me \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\n\n\n\nTop Comments:\nFor better shoe recommendations please include as much as possible of the following information:\n\n1.

I\u2019ve felt that a few times. \n\nFor the Wow Lows how did you find the size compared to the Encores? I own the AC 12 in size 12. I\u2019m usually a size 11.5 but after size 11 I can\u2019t find half sizes. 12 is just too big for me but I can picture 11 would be too narrow. So if the WOW lows are a bit longer or a bit smaller I can probably just go either 11 or 12. Assuming they aren\u2019t as narrow.\nAR2\u2019s are a sleeper for sure. Most peeps won\u2019t know about em cause it\u2019s Rigorer, not sold in stores, or just slaves to the swoosh brand. Pros: anymore but just because i missed it., i knew if i could get back to dunking consistently, that would be a good metric to say i was close to my old self athletically and i\u2019m happy to say mission accomplished \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd still need a few more inches to really be happy but\u2026the proof is in the progress., along with a lotttt of working out, i wanted to find the best shoe possible for my explosive play style both on offense and defense., my all time favorite shoe is the jordan 28 but since i can\u2019t find that anywhere in my size for a reasonable price, i went on the hunt., i tested the nike lebron 21 (before the 22s dropped and i don\u2019t want those either), adidas ae1 low, wow all city 12 encore, nike gt cut 3, rigorer ar 2 and wow 10 low. you can see most of these on my feet in the video but below are my brief reviews in order from worst to best in my opinion.

Lebron 21\u2019s might be the most uncomfortable shoes I\u2019ve ever worn.. what else is out there?\n\nSo I don\u2019t post on reddit much at all, but have used these pages from time to time to get real world reviews. I\u2019m 38 and am getting back into playing ball after 17 years away from the game. I needed new shoes and when I started looking I quickly became overwhelmed. The bball shoe scene is quite different from 20 years ago. I settled on some inexpensive Nike Impact 4\u2019s which felt like shoes I was accustomed to and played with them for a couple months. Fast forward to October and I got the itch for different shoes. I figured there has to be more cushion.. more comfort\u2026 just all around better tech compared to 20 years ago. My searches kept landing on positives about the LeBron 21\u2019s and I ordered them.. the most expensive shoes I have ever bought. Well, long story short on those, they felt incredibly unstable, caused extremity pain within minutes, and bad enough to the point I was glad I had my other shoes in the truck to change in to. I was blown away by how bad they felt. Of course we are all different in build and such, but I never had a shoe I couldn\u2019t make work, even cheap shoes. I guess I expected to be blown away by something that was so often cited as one of the shoes to get in 2024. And LeBron is old too so surely they would work. \n\nSo, what is there out there for an \u201cold\u201d dude? Not sure if it matters for the suggestion but I\u2019m 6\u20192, 220 and play the 4 position in my league. Maybe the Impact 4\u2019s are the way but surely there has to be something better. I have seen some stuff on the Nike GT jump 2\u2019s in regards to good cushioning. But I\u2019m not married to any brand and it seems Nike has dropped some coin making sure their shoes show up in every single search. \n\nSide note: if you\u2019re young and love the game, don\u2019t stop playing. It was like learning how to play all over again this year. But I\u2019m glad I\u2019m back in it. It is weird being called pops are unc on the court though.. doesn\u2019t feel like that long ago I was the young guy out there. \n\nTop Comments:\nI'm 46 and need a lot of cushion.  Right now I'm playing in the New Balance fresh foam BB V2s and they are pretty good.  They seem to be getting better with each run.  I wore Kyrie's before these and they weren't good for me at all.  No cushion and it felt like my toes were being smashed.  I had the KD 14s before those and they were really good until they weren't and they wore out pretty fast\nidk man, I'm almost the exact same age, height and weight as you, with a bad knee, and I like the LeBron 21s. I know not every shoe is perfect for every person, but I wonder if *part* of it is you getting back into balling, and your body getting used to basketball-specific movement.\n\nIt may very well be that your body needs a different cushioning setup, but the 21s get high marks/good reviews for a reason. And I've played in *a lot* of different brands and cushioning setups (tbh it's kind of a problem, I have way too many shoes now)\nI have 2 pairs of the LBJ 21 because I, like you, had read so many great reviews. They took forever to break in and were painful for what seemed like weeks longer than they should\u2019ve been. I\u2019m a big guy and shoes usually don\u2019t stand a chance. After a couple of months playing 2-3x a week they feel great. \n\nI also bought the GTJump2 and while they are more comfortable with way more cushion but they do feel clunky. \n\nI\u2019d like to try NB like the other commenter or AI1 or Harden\nWhat color did you get? \n\nI\u2019m in my 40s, and there is no better shoe for me than the LeBron 20/21. I\u2019m 6\u20196\u201d 235lbs. \n\nThe comfort of LeBron 20/21 largely depends on the color you choose, assuming you got the right size. \n\nThe new colorways (all red, all grey, lilac, mismatch) are very stiff and uncomfortable.\nBreak those in. Lebron 21s are notorious for long ass break in time. Pros: blem, i have way too many shoes now), i have 2 pairs of the lbj 21 because i, like you, had read so many great reviews. they took forever to break in and were painful for what seemed like weeks longer than they should\u2019ve been. i\u2019m a big guy and shoes usually don\u2019t stand a chance. after a couple of months playing 2-3x a week they feel great., i also bought the gtjump2 and while they are more comfortable with way more cushion but they do feel clunky., i\u2019d like to try nb like the other commenter or ai1 or harden, what color did you get?",

Cut 3's in the colorway of \"Barely Volt\" / \"The Illusionist\" And this is my followup review performance-wise to these beautiful shoes after roughly 2 months\n\nLink to original post [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BBallShoes/comments/1irgqm1/newest_pick_up_gt_cut_3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nStarting up, I'd like to mention that i wear a Nike size 42 EU, and i went with a size 42 EU, fits perfect. \n\nTthe toebox suede. Creases, CREASES! I see me getting more creasing on the shoes as time goes by. Not a bad thing but it is pretty prominent IMO as well with they WILL get dirty and pick up grime. Not really as bad as other shoes i've had, and the rest of the materials on the shoe feel really premium.\n\nThe back of the shoe is pretty tall and my foot sits very low in the shoe, but jumping with these shoes at first... Hurts? The back of the shoe stabs my achilles but getting used to it isn't a big issue, around the third time wearing this shoe I didn't really notice it anymore.\n\nGrip? Meh. I knew these were going to perform poorly on dusty courts but I didn't think it was going to be this bad? I play 50/50 on dusty and clean courts, I've tried these on different materials, Hardwood courts and Polyurethane courts and all of them have had the same problems, however they have been more prominent in the dusty courts. The bite is really good though after cleaning by hand, but beware you have to clean it ALOT OF TIMES while you play.  \n  \nI have included three photos of the outsoles. I'm not the kind of player who often cleans their outsoles ingame, but this shoe has made me start doing it, a good habit? I don't know.   \n  \nThe outsole isn't the only reason I feel like this shoe has bad grip. The whole upper isn't really sturdy. It bends really easily and i can notice it when doing rapid launches to sprints or quick lateral movements- I can't seem to get good grip unless i slow down movements or launch with my foot in the right way downwards that a good amount of outsole hits the floor and gets bite. It's kind of contradicting the G.T. \\*CUT\\* because doing cuts in this shoe is difficult, how ironic. People have been saying the outsole wears out, I have not seen anything that could indicate that so far. \n\nI lace my shoes tight, but there still seems to just be a little too much play in the toebox to get that perfect launch. I am a pretty lanky 6'2 170lbs ish dude who isn't that quick laterally and my running looks like a baby giraffe trying to walk for the first time every once in a while, after a while you get used to what you can and can't do, and it feels okay. I've YET to roll my ankle in these, so atleast there is some kind of stability. \n\nAirflow: Bad. Feels like under the laces is the only breathable spot. I personally don't have problems with breathability except in really long sessions.\n\n  \nLooks: Two months of use 3-5 times per week and these still look amazing. Only thing is the random scuffing on the plastic parts... and the dust making the black outsole look waaay worse than it actually is lol\n\n  \nThe ZoomX foam is really good, I like it. Although it doesn't feel as good as Nike's react foam in my opinion, it still is very good and probably is one of the reasons this shoe has pretty good stability. Because it is crampped in the middle of the shoe under the heel and not on the sides, walking and landings feel really good with the heel having almost no sideways movements. \n\nThink of the heel cushioning like the letter V, Your foot only goes down the middle of the V. It keeps it in a good stable spot with the supports on the side if it tends to move.\n\nWeight: Very good weight-wise, 335 grams of pure speed. Love it.\n\nI also had my first ever dunk in these shoes last week. I personally don't think it was the shoes that helped me, but having more confidence in your step with good shoes 100% helps so... i guess it kinda helped...?\n\n  \nConclusion: Was it worth it?\n\nYes. I bought these for a discount price of 120\u20ac / $125. At that price these are an amazing buy. The retail price is originally WAY too much, as for what i personally think a fair price for these is $150ish. If you can get the for under that, amazing buy. You won't regret it.

    "text": "Sneakers vs Running Shoes. A Small Guide Sneakers vs Running Shoes. A Small Guide\n\nI've seen plenty of people ask about running shoes in this sub, specifically regarding Ultra Boosts and runners. As a semi sneakerhead and avid runner, I thought I'd help give some advice on the issue. \n\n\nDepending on how much you plan to run, it is usually best to forfeit style for function. There are many brands who make running shoes, but the best ones are Asics, Brooks, New Balance, Nike, and Saucony. \n\n****************************************\n***Asics***\n\nThe best looking Asics are not the best running shoes. The Gel-Lyte series are more of a lifestyle shoe. While Asics is generally the best overall, there are many individual shoes that aren't as good as the competition. Their best shoes are the Gel and GT series. I have some [Gel Kahanas](https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Gel-Kahana-Runner-Sulphur-Spring/dp/B017SH712W/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1483133968&sr=8-2&keywords=Asics+Gel+Kahana) that I use for trail runs, and they've held up for about 8 miles a week over the past four years. They are a good entry level shoe, if you are looking to start running a bit, and have an excellent lifespan. \n\n***Brooks***\n\nBrooks does not make any sneakers, so I assume they are not very well known here. Their best model, the Launch, one of the best neutral running shoes available, does look nice in the [black and white colorway.](http://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/launch-3-mens-running-shoes/110215.html?dwvar_110215_color=074&dwvar_110215_width=D#q=launch&start=2) Similarly, the [Ghost,](https://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/brooks-ghost-9-mens-running-shoes/110233.html?dwvar_110233_color=999#q=ghost&start=2) [Adrenaline,](http://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/adrenaline-gts-17-mens-running-shoes/110241.html) and [Ravenna](http://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/ravenna-7-mens-running-shoes/110217.html?dwvar_110217_color=116#q=ravenna&start=2) series are all good choices for stable runs. \n\n***New Balance***\n\nNew Balance is similar to Asics in that they have a very large selection of good running shoes. That being said, they also have a sole that's similar but different to the Adidas Boost. Their Fresh Foam series is firmer than Boost, allowing for a more stable run while remaining much more neutral than other shoes. The [Zante V2](http://www.newbalance.com/pd/fresh-foam-zante-v2/MZANT-V2.html?dwvar_MZANT-V2_color=Blue_with_Black#color=Black_with_Silver) and [Vongo](http://www.newbalance.com/pd/fresh-foam-vongo/MVNGO.html?dwvar_MVNGO_color=Blue_with_Black#color=Dark Denim_with_Hi-Lite) are excellent neutral running shoes. If you're willing to forgo all style, any of their *x number* v *y number* shoes will last you years. I have a pair of 860v3s that have seen about 750ish miles and would still provide me a decent run if I put them on right now. \n\n***Nike***\n\nPersonally, I am not a fan of of Nike running shoes for large mileage. Anything over 25 miles a week, Nike should not be considered as there are cheaper and better options. That being said however, the [Zoom Pegasus](http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/air-zoom-pegasus-33-mens-running-shoe/pid-10944624/pgid-11816664) is excellent. I feel that it is their only good shoe for long distances, and it comes with the added bonus that it looks good and can be used for shorter distances obviously. Shoes such as any of their Free or Lunar models, such as the [Free RN](http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/free-rn-mens-running-shoe/pid-10944646/pgid-11831605) or [LunarGlide 8](http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/lunarglide-8-mens-running-shoe/pid-11055854/pgid-11820468) will work well for around less than 25 miles a week. But Nike's real strength is with its racing shoes. Their spikes are the best on the market, for both Track and Cross-Country. And the Flyknit Racer is outstanding for a road race or track workout, and in my opinion, is the nicest looking shoe there is. \n\n***Saucony***\n\nSaucony is similar to Asics. There are excellent shoes, but they forfeit all style for some of the best function. I have run in the Kinvara series in every model from the 3-7, and the Kinvara 6 has been my favorite shoe I have ever run in. The [black and white colorway](https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Mens-Kinvara-Running-Shoe/dp/B010160C4Q?th=1) looks good on foot, and it is one of the best neutral shoes I have run in. Other models such as the [Mirage](https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Mens-Mirage-Running-Citron/dp/B00KPU4EA2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483136775&sr=8-1&keywords=saucony+mirage) and [Triumph Iso](http://www.saucony.com/en/triumph-iso-3/27460M.html?ref=triumph%20iso%202&dwvar_27460M_color=S20346-2#q=triumph+iso+2&start=1) are excellent neutral shoes, while the [Ride](http://www.saucony.com/en/ride-9/24980M.html?ref=ride&dwvar_24980M_color=S20364-1#reviews) and [Guide](http://www.saucony.com/en/guide-10-wide/27441M.html?ref=guide&dwvar_27441M_color=S20351-1#q=guide&start=1) series are well-built stability shoes. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention the [Type A.](http://www.saucony.com/en/type-a/21935M.html) The Type A is a lightweight road racing flat, like the Flyknit Racer. I use it for track workouts, and it is one of the nicest feeling shoes I've run in. If you are looking into races from any distance up to a marathon, the Type A works excellently\n\n***Other***\n\nI am not a fan of Boost for running. I've found the Ultra Boost to be not supportive enough, and the Boost doesn't last as long as many shoes. While the Energy Boost and Adizero Adios and Boston are good shoes, they pale in comparison to others. \n\nWhere Nike lacks in long distance shoes, they make up in gear. I have never been indifferent to Nike gear, and I have always loved running in their clothes. \n\nIn regards to other sportswear brands such as Reebok, Under Armor, and Puma, it's best to stick to gear. Their shoes are more suited for training, as they haven't made any standout running shoes. \n\n********************************\n***Bottom Line***\n\nHopefully I've helped if you needed clarification on running shoes vs sneakers. If you are looking to really get serious into running, please don't make your choice in shoes based solely on this. Find a shoe that looks like it suits your needs, and **try it on in a running store.** Plenty of stores will have a treadmill where you can test out the shoe. There is no one cut and dry formula for finding a running shoe. Just don't prioritize style\n\nTop Comments:\nGreat post!\n\n\nGetting into running is actually what got me back into sneakers; I started long distance training a few years ago and wanted to buy up every pair I read about to test out something new and in doing so aquiring a new pair each month gave me the taste for more.\n\n\nI'll tack on my own $.02 from my experience for anyone else interested in getting serious about actual running (and echo some of the sentiments above): try to head to your local running store (not a Foot Locker or even Niketown, although they do have dedicated runners working there) and work your way from there. Just like how everyone has a different foot shape, everyone has a different stride, foot strike and overall body type that all have an effect on what type of shoe you need. And every shoe manufacturer, no matter their reputation, all create shoes that may or may not fit your needs.\n\n\nI've run in everything from Adidas Adios Boosts (NYC marathon winners in 2014) to Nike Free 4.0s and my biggest takeaway is that despite any marketing, technology claims, or even price, overall comfort is key as well as finding something that will suit your training needs.\n\n\nI'll also echo \"**don't prioritize style**\" (however some of my highest mileage runners have also been my favorite looks wise: Nike Lunaracer 3s (300+ miles), NB Zante V1s (200+ miles), and Nike Zoom Flyknit Streaks (100+ miles)), and add to that **prioritize what your body needs along with the type of training you intend to do**.\n\n\nDefinitely try running shoes on in a store and if you can, wear them for 3 or 4 training runs before making a final decision. I highly recommend Running Warehouse as they provide a ton of info on each shoe and sport a pretty great return policy if you want to try out a new pair (I ended up retuning the adios boosts after a month as they ended up destroying my knees). And I'm certain local shops have similar policies with respect to how a shoe works out for you after breaking it in a bit.\n\n\nThere are a ton of great running shoes out there! Many of which haven't even been named here (Hoka One One, Newton, and even Sketchers! (2014 Boston Marathon winners)), so if you enjoy buying up pairs for style, I highly recommend (or don't ;) ) getting into running. It's fun, keeps you in shape, and gives you another excuse to dish out cash on some new kicks :)\nThe Brooks Heritage line falls into the sneakers category, FYI.\nKeep in mind saucony does make some pretty nice sneakers, ie the Shadow line, originals, jazz, etc.\nhm i actually bought my first pair of Ultraboosts [this colorway](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5283b109e4b01e8cfd59170f/t/5533d1d2e4b05a690b3f5273/1429459412416/?format=1000w) because i needed a pair of running shoes. that was before the hype for the UB even began. i really just liked the cushion that i got when i was wearing them and it felt great for me to run in them. \nSome inaccuracies with the verbiage here. Ride and Ghost are neutral and the Vongo and Mirage (which they're phasing out both have a touch of stability to them. I've gotten easily 40+ miles a week on Nikes before, try the Vomero for a more cushioned option. Pros: vide me a decent run if i put them on right now., personally, i am not a fan of of nike running shoes for large mileage. anything over 25 miles a week, nike should not be considered as there are cheaper and better options. that being said however, the [zoom pegasus](http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/air-zoom-pegasus-33-mens-running-shoe/pid-10944624/pgid-11816664) is excellent. i feel that it is their only good shoe for long distances, and it comes with the added bonus that it looks good and can be used for shorter distances obviously. shoes such as any of their free or lunar models, such as the [free rn](http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/free-rn-mens-running-shoe/pid-10944646/pgid-11831605) or [lunarglide 8](http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/lunarglide-8-mens-running-shoe/pid-11055854/pgid-11820468) will work well for around less than 25 miles a week. but nike's real strength is with its racing shoes. their spikes are the best on the market, for both track and cross-country. and the flyknit racer is outstanding for a road race or track workout, and in my opinion, is the nicest looking shoe there is., saucony***, saucony is similar to asics. there are excellent shoes, but they forfeit all style for some of the best function. i have run in the kinvara series in every model from the 3-7, and the kinvara 6 has been my favorite shoe i have ever run in. the [black and white colorway](https://www.amazon.com/saucony-mens-kinvara-running-shoe/dp/b010160c4q?th=1) looks good on foot, and it is one of the best neutral shoes i have run in. other models such as the [mirage](https://www.amazon.com/saucony-mens-mirage-running-citron/dp/b00kpu4ea2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&qid=1483136775&sr=8-1&keywords=saucony+mirage) and [triumph iso](http://www.saucony.com/en/triumph-iso-3/27460m.html?ref=triumph%20iso%202&dwvar_27460m_color=s20346-2#q=triumph+iso+2&start=1) are excellent neutral shoes, while the [ride](http://www.saucony.com/en/ride-9/24980m.html?ref=ride&dwvar_24980m_color=s20364-1#reviews) and [guide](http://www.saucony.com/en/guide-10-wide/27441m.html?ref=guide&dwvar_27441m_color=s20351-1#q=guide&start=1) series are well-built stability shoes., edit: forgot to mention the [type a.](http://www.saucony.com/en/type-a/21935m.html) the type a is a lightweight road racing flat, like the flyknit racer. i use it for track workouts, and it is one of the nicest feeling shoes i've run in. if you are looking into races from any distance up to a marathon, the type a works excellently Cons: , asics***, the best looking asics are not the best running shoes. the gel-lyte series are more of a lifestyle shoe. while asics is generally the best overall, there are many individual shoes that aren't as good as the competition. their best shoes are the gel and gt series. i have some [gel kahanas](https://www.amazon.com/asics-gel-kahana-runner-sulphur-spring/dp/b017sh712w/ref=sr_1_2?ie=utf8&qid=1483133968&sr=8-2&keywords=asics+gel+kahana) that i use for trail runs, and they've held up for about 8 miles a week over the past four years. they are a good entry level shoe, if you are looking to start running a bit, and have an excellent lifespan., brooks***, brooks does not make any sneakers, so i assume they are not very well known here. their best model, the launch, one of the best neutral running shoes available, does look nice in the [black and white colorway.](http://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/launch-3-mens-running-shoes/110215.html?dwvar_110215_color=074&dwvar_110215_width=d#q=launch&start=2) similarly, the [ghost,](https://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/brooks-ghost-9-mens-running-shoes/110233.html?dwvar_110233_color=999#q=ghost&start=2) [adrenaline,](http://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/adrenaline-gts-17-mens-running-shoes/110241.html) and [ravenna](http://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/ravenna-7-mens-running-shoes/110217.html?dwvar_110217_color=116#q=ravenna&start=2) series are all good choices for stable runs.",
